Even identical looking devices tend to behave in subtly different ways, such as by supporting different sets of fonts. It\u2019s as if each device has its own personality. This means that even if you clear your cookies or log out of a website, your device fingerprint can still give away who you are.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EWorse, the distinction between commercial tracking and government surveillance is thin and getting thinner. The satirical website \u003Cem\u003EThe Onion \u003C/em\u003Eonce ran a story with this headline: \u201cCIA's \u2018Facebook\u2019 Program Dramatically Cut Agency's Costs.\u201d Reality isn\u2019t far off. The Snowden leaks \u003Ca href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-switch/wp/2013/12/10/nsa-uses-google-cookies-to-pinpoint-targets-for-hacking/\"\u003Erevealed\u003C/a\u003E that the NSA piggybacks on advertising cookies, and in a technical paper we \u003Ca href=\"http://senglehardt.com/papers/www15_cookie_surveil.pdf\"\u003Eshowed\u003C/a\u003E that this can be devastatingly effective. Hacks and data breaches of commercial systems have also become a major part of the strategies of nation-state actors.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EThe good news is how effective technology can be in preventing tracking. We found that ad blockers and other browser-privacy tools can decrease tracking by 80 percent or more. More complex tools such as the Tor browser can be even more effective. In other words, the more technically savvy among us can enjoy dramatically better privacy and digital freedoms. But this has resulted in a technological \u201carms race,\u201d which is worrying by itself, but also because such technical skill correlates with historically advantaged groups. Meanwhile, publishers are caught in the ad-blocking crossfire, endangering the free press.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Cp dir=\"ltr\"\u003EOne bright spot is that online privacy research has had a tremendous effect. It has helped regulators curb the worst of the offenses, forced companies to roll back incursions because of public-relations pressure, spurred the development of privacy tools, and fomented a healthy public debate about online tracking. The fight for privacy is now inextricably linked to the fight for digital civil liberties and democratic values, and it is a movement that includes activists, artists, journalists, researchers, and everyday users of technology. There\u2019s tremendous power in your hands to take charge of your own privacy as well as foster these societal values.\u003C/p\u003E\u003Chr\u003E\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003E\u003Csmall\u003EThis article is part of a collaboration with the Markkula Center for Applied Ethics at Santa Clara University.\u003C/small\u003E\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E","title":"The Thinning Line Between Commercial and Government Surveillance"},{"feed_item_id":2609167015,"published_at":1494845515,"created_at":1494846024,"version_key":1494846024,"updated_at":1494846024,"starred":false,"read":false,"read_later":false,"author":"Pascal Klau","feed_id":3998,"feed_name":"CSS-Tricks","url":"https://css-tricks.com/combine-webpack-gulp-4/","body":"\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://webpack.github.io/\"\u003EWebpack\u003C/a\u003E is so hot right now!

I was thrilled with this direction, because that was the book I wanted to read. As a diehard fan of Jonathan\u2019s fiction, I gravitated towards his essays on books and literature \u0026#8212; I found them addictive, sneakily-instructive, and full of the same joyful inquiry and insight that\u2019s so prevalent in\u00a0\u003Cem\u003EEcstasy\u003C/em\u003E.

Along the way, too, I found myself lobbying for a rather broad definition of \u0026#8220;books and writers\u201d\u00a0so that we could include as many essays as possible. I remember really wanting to include Jonathan\u0026#8217;s fictional exchange between his character Perkus Tooth and director \u003Cstrong\u003ESpike Jonze\u003C/strong\u003E (\u201cThe Original Piece of Wood I Left in Your Head\u201d), for example.

Jonathan sent me 60 or so pieces to review, and we met to discuss the project in early 2016. It was during that meeting that we first talked about the idea of a \u201cbook on books.\u201d With a preliminary theme in mind, I dug in and started looking for threads in the essays that could inform their sequencing and the book\u0026#8217;s scope and shape. These pieces were published at different times and in a variety of venues, so our reader was going to have do some time travel. And I didn\u2019t want them to feel \u201cunstuck,\u201d or mapless. So I searched for ways for the book to stake out its range and territory early on \u0026#8212; that was certainly my goal in the first chapter, \u201cEngulf and Devour,\u201d which shifts from a \u201cdevotion\u201d on a book from Jonathan\u2019s childhood to pieces on\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0142437247/ref=nosim/themill0b-20\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EMoby-Dick\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/a\u003E and Philip Roth.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELater in the book, the essays focus in on specific writers (\u003Cstrong\u003EKazuo Ishiguro\u003C/strong\u003E, Philip K. Dick), link thematically (as in the last chapter, \u201cFan Mail\u201d), or connect via what I think of as \u201cchannels\u201d \u0026#8212;\u00a0inquiries or enthusiasms that reappear in different garb. I love the various forms of nostalgia expressed in the chapter \u201cIt Can Still Take Me There,\u201d for example \u0026#8212; there\u2019s a piece on the character of Batman, and further on, an essay about Jonathan\u2019s encounter with the beat hero \u003Cstrong\u003EHerbert Huncke\u003C/strong\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the book took shape, Jonathan sent along other pieces that might fit. To my delight, he also wrote some new essays that helped round out the chapters and complete some of the narratives therein. One of my favorite pieces in the book, for example, is his \u201cFootnote on \u003Cstrong\u003EThomas Berger\u003C/strong\u003E,\u201d a new piece that follows two previously-published essays on Berger. I won\u2019t spoil it, but it\u2019s an astounding story.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEditorially, most of the heavy lifting took place last summer. Since most of these pieces were previously published, I saw my work as a sort of literary forensics: I read the manuscript version against the published version, and sent Jonathan edits that catalogued all editorial discrepancies and suggested a way forward. I sent these to Jonathan in batches of 10 or so and he returned finalized versions. Overall, my edits were modest \u0026#8212;\u00a0these essays were already in fighting shape. We settled on a preliminary structure and title by July, and the manuscript was submitted a few weeks later.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJL:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u0026#8217;m fighting the temptation to satirize Chris\u0026#8217;s scrupulous account of all his due diligence with claims of my having handled the perimeter defense, or being the one in charge of bringing the ziplock bags of trail mix. \u0026#8220;First I built a bonfire hot enough to melt down the horse\u0026#8217;s hooves,\u0026#8221; etc. But the truth is that I did nothing so comprehensive or thoughtful even as that. I really just dumped that initial catastrophe\u0026#8217;s worth of pieces on Chris, by means of Dropbox. Then, to make matters worse, I sporadically discovered pieces I\u0026#8217;d missed or forgotten about entirely that were hiding either in dingy corners of the Internet or of my own hard-drive, and sent those along as well.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Chris began to settle on pieces \u0026#8212; which didn\u0026#8217;t happen all at once, but in sequences \u0026#8212; I periodically flew into a panic of rewriting. I think I did a bit more \u0026#8220;improving\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; or at least triage \u0026#8212; on these clumsy old sentences than Chris shows signs of being aware of. Mostly I tried to simplify tormented thoughts into merely agitated ones.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI really like hearing about Chris\u0026#8217;s concerns about the risk of \u0026#8220;maplessness\u0026#8221; and the way he thought of his solution in terms of \u0026#8220;channels.\u0026#8221; I find the design and flow he arrived at consistently surprising and delightful, nothing I\u0026#8217;d have managed myself. That feeling extends to the title of the various sections, and the title of the book itself, which are all Chris\u0026#8217;s discoveries.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETM:\u003C/strong\u003E Readers now can go over the trail themselves to find a discarded ziplock, map in hand.

After the briefest of introductions in late 2015, Jonathan invited me to help steer this ship; I\u2019ll always be grateful for, and amazed by, the trust he showed in me from the get-go.

While I know I\u2019m speaking of a different currency now than the one that drives the gift-economy, the creation of this book was certainly driven by a \u201cGive All\u201d sensibility.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0385539908/ref=nosim/themill0b-20\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0385539908.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg\" alt=\"cover\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ETM:\u003C/strong\u003E That kind of generosity is inspiring.

Doctors Without Borders might seem to me \u0026#8212; I\u0026#8217;ve never thought about this, exactly, before \u0026#8212; like the ultimate opposite of the kind of indirect politics practiced even by the most righteous of us artists and writers (I don\u0026#8217;t mean myself). That\u0026#8217;s to say, where we\u0026#8217;re by definition operating in the realm of the figurative and the intangible, in my case also the hesitant and ambiguous.

It does a great job anticipating a reader\u0026#8217;s objections while full-throatedly supporting a big league writer\u0026#8217;s craft.

Life\u0026#8217;s too short to be intimidated by the books that are waiting only to be picked up and encountered, and then devoured, if you like what\u0026#8217;s on offer \u0026#8212; it\u0026#8217;s like being intimidated by\u00a0\u003Cem\u003Efood\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"http://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/ASIN/0374529965/ref=nosim/themill0b-20\"\u003E\u003Cimg src=\"http://images.amazon.com/images/P/0374529965.01.MZZZZZZZ.jpg\" alt=\"cover\" align=\"right\" border=\"0\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003ECB:\u003C/strong\u003E I\u2019ll resist the urge to go literal here and steer us towards the last piece in the book, \u201cBooks Are Sandwiches,\u201d and say instead that I love this answer because it reminds me, as a reader, to eat what I like and all that I can \u0026#8212; to follow my instincts without regard for anything\u00a0that might obstruct my engagement with the page.

I remember well the experience of reading the latter for the first time, and how the world continued buzzing for me even when I wasn\u2019t reading it; it felt like having a pair of anti-gravity boots stowed away in my backpack. No other object has informed my life quite like my favorite novels have.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFrom a craft perspective, the novel caters to the kinds of risks that I like to take in my writing.\u00a0Because of my early influences, perhaps, I\u2019m drawn to building my own strange machines.\u00a0Also, I don\u2019t\u00a0\u003Cem\u003Ethink\u00a0\u003C/em\u003Enovelistically, as I know some writers do.\u00a0I have to think small, write small, and I only find my novels once I\u2019m inside them. I began my second book, for example, with one stand-alone piece about a piano that changes your point of view, and another about a character who has a sentence for a pet.\u00a0It wasn\u2019t until a year later, maybe, that I admitted to myself that these should be part of the same narrative. At the core of my process is a certain unease or anxiety about the form, and I\u2019m glad for that \u0026#8212; I think it\u2019s a good place to write from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEven so, I marvel at those writers who seem to have an easier relationship with the form. Jonathan\u2019s one of my favorite living novelists, and for me his novels are built like tanks \u0026#8212; each one different from the last, and yet always dizzyingly inventive, uniquely ambitious, and expertly constructed.\u00a0 Reading\u00a0\u003Cem\u003EA Gambler\u2019s Anatomy\u003C/em\u003E, for example, I was amazed by its grand design \u0026#8212; the way that the narrative arc, pacing, and sentence-level music all work together. I\u2019m curious to hear what he has to say about a form to which he clearly brings such mastery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cstrong\u003EJL:\u003C/strong\u003E \u0026#8220;A novelist\u0026#8217;s bag of novels and novelists\u0026#8221; \u0026#8212; you make it sound like a sack of cats!

Or a smaller one who is struggling with a very large sack.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWell, I doubt I could write a more impassioned love letter to the novel than Chris B. has done here, so instead I\u0026#8217;ll play the feisty elder, and remind you young whippersnappers what Norman Mailer said when someone played devil\u0026#8217;s advocate about the viability of his chosen form (some of which devil\u0026#8217;s advocacy I think I hear in your question).

It is a wazoo with a view.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOkay, to be a bit more serious, I really have come to understand that the humbling mystery of my chosen practice is how capacious the damn thing is.

The two are simultaneous immersions, never resolving their permanent juxtaposition. The novel actually captures this! How incredible. And even the shortest and simplest novel is oceanic, confusing, too big to get your head around, or see all at once (again, like life).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnyway, this here bag of cats \u0026#8212; it\u0026#8217;s got other things in it, I swear.

They had a son named Urban, which was common as both a first and a last name locally. Common, perhaps, but not much spoken; Urban of course had a nickname. He was known as Red. Urban, unironically, was born on a farm outside town, moved in for a few years after his family built the hotel, then left to attend boarding schools in Dubuque. That brief local residence was enough to get his name now affixed to signs on the US 151 bypass heading into town. Cascade: \u201cHome of Red Faber.\u201d You very well may never have heard of Red Faber, but he\u2019s in the baseball Hall of Fame.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHe played ball at school, but not particularly well. He bloomed a couple years later at a small college in Dubuque. From there he went to the old Three-I League, where he threw a perfect game, with only one ball actually reaching the outfield. This attracted the attention of a major league team, the Pittsburgh Pirates, which signed him to a contract, then never put him on the field before assigning him back to the minor leagues.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBeing reassigned to the Minneapolis Millers in 1911 was a turning point in Faber\u2019s career. Although gifted and as strong as a plow horse, he had done little that would recommend him at the major league level. When he was sent to Minneapolis, he appeared in only five games; he was injured for the entire time he was with the Millers. At the request of the Millers\u2019 management, Pittsburgh shipped Faber on to Pueblo, Colorado, a team in the Western League. Little wonder\u2014in 24\u00a0and a third innings, he gave up 33\u00a0hits, ten walks, and 19\u00a0runs.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that brief stopover in Minnesota changed Faber\u2019s career. While recuperating from his injuries in the Millers\u2019 bullpen, he met an undistinguished career minor leaguer named Harry Peaster. Peaster taught Faber how to throw a spitball. Faber, like nearly every pitcher, fooled around with different pitches all the time and had experimented with the spitter, which was then a popular pitch, although to little good effect. This time the pitch took, perhaps because he was injured; to protect his arm, he threw it side-armed and at less than full velocity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn the waves of experimentation that had followed the liberalization of pitching rules in the nineteenth century, one of the largest ripples was the practice of physically defacing or altering the surfaces of baseballs. Pitchers lathered tobacco, spit, sweat, mud, tar, oil, shoe polish, and just about anything else they could find onto balls before they delivered them. According to Bill James: \u201cPeople were spitting on the ball, licking the ball, sticking as much of the ball in their mouths as was physically possible, dropping the ball in the mud, scratching it, stepping on it with spikes . . . really making a mockery of the game, plus it was frankly disgusting.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe application of a foreign substance to a baseball causes disturbances in the airflow around the ball when it is thrown; the disturbance alters the spin of the ball, often in erratic ways. The ball might break sideways, or down, or even sail above its expected trajectory. Usually, though, the action of a spitball is very much like the action of a modern-day split-fingered fastball\u2014coming straight to the plate with little movement, then diving at the very end.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPitchers had discovered this in the first years of the game, and in the early decades of the 20th\u00a0century doctored baseballs were an integral part of the game. There is no generally accepted evidence on who first came up with the pitch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFaber regained his winning form at Pueblo with, a local sportswriter claimed, \u201can assortment of curves and shoots that can\u2019t be excelled.\u201d He continued to work on his spitter, and by the end of that summer had regained much of his strength. Late in the season, he threw both ends of a doubleheader and closed the year with a four-hitter. Though he regained his fastball, he realized that he should throw the spitter, with less than maximum effort, for the best result.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cA spitter has to be thrown moderately fast and the ball slips away from under the two front fingers of the pitching hand and sails up to the batter rotating very slowly,\u201d he said.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EThen it breaks down and to one side. What is there unnatural about that or hard on the arm? I have been using a spit ball for some years and I have never been able to discover. They say it is unsanitary. Well I won\u2019t argue about that.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EI never wet the ball but merely the ends of the first two fingers on my right hand. The whole theory of the spit ball is to let the ball slide away from a smooth surface. Wetting the fingers gives this smooth surface. By the time the ball has traveled through the air, met the bat and been driven to some infielder it is perfectly dry. No infielder needs to make an error on such a ball. Of course, I can\u2019t say that some spitball pitchers haven\u2019t misused the privilege. But they didn\u2019t need to and that disposes of the myth that the spitter causes a lot of errors by infielders. It may have done so, but it didn\u2019t need to, properly handled. A spit ball pitcher always chews something. It\u2019s an odd thing, but I have had to experiment with things to chew. Some spit ball pitchers use slippery elm. Slippery elm doesn\u2019t work with me. It\u2019s too slippery and I can\u2019t control the ball. I have tried chewing gum. But that wasn\u2019t quite slippery enough. So I have had to fall back on the good old custom, now much abused, of chewing tobacco. Tobacco juice fills the bill. And I don\u2019t chew it because I like it either. In fact, I never chew except when I am pitching. But it seems to be an indispensable part of my business like a mason\u2019s trowel or a carpenter\u2019s hammer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFaber came to the major leagues in the middle of what is called the dead-ball era. In its earliest days, baseball was a high-scoring affair. As pitchers became more sophisticated in the early days of the 20th\u00a0century, the number of runs scored declined steeply. With pitchers aided by their new pitches, including the practice of defacing balls, and by a batting approach that favored scoring single runs at a time, the average number of runs declined to less than four per game. The nadir was reached in 1908, when the average dropped to 3.38 runs. A new, more lively ball was introduced, and hitters began taking a more aggressive approach at the plate. Unsafe, unsavory, or simply unfair, the spitball was finally sentenced to death prior to the 1920 season. Another new rule called for the replacement of balls that had become dirty or defaced. Not long after, and all of sudden, an erstwhile pitcher named Babe Ruth was hitting 50\u00a0home runs a year. The game changed dramatically. Home runs increased by two-thirds during this new live-ball era, which lasted until 1947, when the next great change in the game occurred. It had nothing to do with equipment, but with the players. Jackie Robinson broke the color barrier.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFaber was one of the few pitchers to make a successful transition from the dead-ball era to the new homer-happy approach. He was one of seventeen players who were recognized as spitball specialists and exempted from the new rule; they were allowed to continue throwing the pitch for as long as their careers lasted. Faber pitched into his mid-forties, finally retiring in 1933. He won 254 games, a place in the Hall of Fame, and that sign on the outskirts of Cascade.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFaber was the second to last of the legal spitballers. Burleigh Grimes outlasted him by a year, retiring in 1934. That did not, of course, mean there were no more spitballs. The spitter flourished as an illegal pitch from the time it was banned up to today, despite the scrutiny of high-definition cameras that capture every eyeblink and muscle twitch on the field. If a pitcher wants to cheat, and isn\u2019t blatant about it, there is very little anyone is going to do to stop him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe most notorious spitball pitchers used their reputations to their advantage. Preacher Roe, who had great success mainly with the Brooklyn Dodgers in the late 1940s and early \u201950s, made the spitball his go-to pitch after an injury diminished his fastball. He had a well-established routine when preparing to throw the spitter, bringing his hands up to his cap and spitting onto them, then transferring the spit to his belt and finally his fingers. When hitters learned what he was doing, he would throw a fastball off the same routine, using the threat of the spitter as effectively as the spitter itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ERoe admitted his use of the spitter only after he retired. A generation later, Gaylord Perry, after a decade of suspicions, inspections, and denials, and barely halfway through a long career, wrote a memoir called \u003Cem\u003EMe and the Spitter: An Autobiographical Confession. \u003C/em\u003EAnd then immediately went back to denying he had ever done anything untoward. The question of whether he did or didn\u2019t worked so well to his advantage that he became the winningest spitballer in history. Let me repeat: they\u2019re all bastards, you know.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E__________________________________\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cimg data-attachment-id=\"66288\" data-permalink=\"http://lithub.com/the-fine-art-of-cheating-in-baseball/attachment/9780307379429/\" data-orig-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9780307379429.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"302,450\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Off Speed\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9780307379429-201x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9780307379429.jpg\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-66288\" src=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9780307379429-201x300.jpg\" alt=\"Off Speed\" width=\"201\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9780307379429-201x300.jpg 201w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/9780307379429.jpg 302w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 201px) 100vw, 201px\" /\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"text-align: center;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EExcerpted from\u003C/em\u003E\u00a0\u003Ca href=\"http://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/207117/off-speed-by-terry-mcdermott/9780307379429/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003EOFF SPEED\u003C/a\u003E \u003Cem\u003Eby Terry McDermott.

But I\u2019d been aware of the small city in middle Tennessee since 2010, when the local Muslim community\u2019s decision to build a new mosque for its growing congregation spurred a small but alarmingly vicious opposition that made the national news. The mosque finally opened after a two-year saga of vandalism, arson, protests, counter-protests, lawsuits and federal intervention; all the ugly twists and turns closely covered by the media. I remember reading that Victoria Jackson had shown up at the newly-opened mosque; I wondered why the woman from Weekend Update was there before discovering that the former SNL comedian I loved as a kid had become a raging Islamophobe. For purveyors of anti-Islam hysteria, Murfreesboro had become a requisite stop, a prime photo-op.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Muslims following the news from afar, the city represented the dark underbelly of an increasingly Islamophobic America. But for the citizens of Murfreesboro, the majority of whom spoke out in support of the mosque and the Muslim community, it was simply home. By the time I was invited to the Southeastern Young Adult Book Festival there this spring, I\u2019d lived in nearby Nashville for several years, and had met a number of interesting people who lived or taught in Murfreesboro. It had become an actual place to me, rather than a locus for anti-Muslim hatred, imagined and filtered through the media. In 2010, I would have been nervous about going to Murfreesboro. I wasn\u2019t anymore.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn the first day of the festival, middle-school and high-school students from throughout middle Tennessee were bussed in from their respective schools to Middle Tennessee State University in Murfreesboro for their own dedicated day of festivities. It was free for them, their numbers restricted only by venue capacity\u20142000 students, nearly all of whom seemed very excited to be there. Some of these students had never attended a book festival before, many had come in from rural areas, some had always been avid readers, and some had become readers after attending the inaugural festival the year before. The audience was majority white, but more socioeconomically and racially diverse than many festivals I\u2019d attended.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt the festival, the authors spoke openly of the themes addressed in their books: growing up LGBTQ, discovering you\u2019re intersex, dealing with aftermath of sexual assault, and more. There was not enough time for all of the students\u2019 questions. The fact such a festival existed and thrived in a very red state was a powerful reminder that things were always more complicated than they seemed. I had a new association with Murfreesboro: a sense of hope.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut it was a hope complicated by place. As I walked around downtown with two other authors, a pickup truck draped with a massive Confederate flag began to slowly circle Murfreesboro\u2019s historic square, blaring music. On our way back, we were stopped at a red light behind a different pickup truck, flying a Confederate flag, the pair of truck nuts attached to its rear bumper hanging so big and low they practically scraped the asphalt.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Nashville, it was easy to remain in a relatively liberal bubble, a little blue dot populated with former Bernie supporters and hippie Christian bumper stickers promoting love for all. These blatantly aggressive and particularly Southern displays of white supremacy still startled me, as did the jarring juxtapositions of the changing metropolitan South: a gay bar near a church sign condemning gays as sinners, a Black Lives Matter march passing by businesses and restaurants marketed as evocations of plantation life. And here, in a county in which nearly 2/3rds of residents voted for a man who\u2019s proud of not reading books to be president, a lovely literary festival was encouraging thousands of kids to become readers. In many ways, Murfreesboro was a microcosm of the best and worst of America.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAt Murfreesboro\u2019s YA book festival, I was the only Muslim author. There are still very few of us, so this was unsurprising. As a Muslim-American author who writes about Muslim characters, I sometimes feel like I\u2019m on and off a soapbox, reminding audiences of the dangerous divisiveness of Islamophobic rhetoric, explaining that Muslims are a diverse group of people who defy any stereotype. It is, in fact, a community so varied in race, ethnicity, sect, class, cultural histories and religious outlook that it can seem a little disingenuous to even be speaking on their behalf. Aside from having to deal with Islamophobia, whether directly or indirectly, there is no singular Muslim-American experience, but with so few books about Muslim teens and so much hatred, the soapbox comes with the narrative territory.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EOn one panel, we were asked if we write our books with the intention to deliver a message. Most of the writers said they deliberately tried to avoid any kind of message; if the reader came away with one, it was because they chose to, not because the book explicitly promoted it. I told the students that writing about Muslim-American experiences sent a message that Muslims are complex people with fully realized lives. This type of \u201cmessage\u201d should be obvious, but we live in a racially- and religiously-charged time in which young Muslims feel so besieged they feel it necessary to make videos in defense of their own humanity, proclaiming that they are good, ordinary people and not terrorists. When the government has banned Muslims from certain countries from entering America, I explained, simply writing about Muslims as empathetic people is in and of itself a message.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAfter the panel ended, two white teenage girls approached the stage. I could tell they were eager to say something, so I greeted them with my YA author enthusiasm, waving them forward.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs they stepped up to the table, their nervous excitement was palpable.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cWe just want you to know,\u201d one of the girls said, \u201cthat you are welcome here.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMy initial reaction was confusion. I was born and raised here; I have never been or felt anything but American. I\u2019d always assumed that my American-ness was self-evident; my trips abroad had told me that America was in my walk, my attitude, and unmistakably, often painfully, in my voice, its sound and cadence, in the indelibly American accent that commandeered my Urdu and any other language I attempted to learn, prompting rickshaw drivers in India to declare, within 30 seconds of talking to me in Hindi, \u201cYou\u2019re not from here.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut, I reasoned, I was wearing a sari, and had been talking about Muslims, two things that might have led these girls to identify me as foreign. It was also possible that they knew I was American, but had interpreted my words to mean I no longer felt welcome in my own country, and so had decided to come reassure me that, indeed, I was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI realized they were being nice, but found this reassurance deeply unsettling. What did this say about privilege, that two white teenage girls felt themselves in a position enough to validate the presence of a 40-year-old woman of color? I couldn\u2019t imagine the 15-year-old me, awkward, brown, going up to a 40-year-old white woman to assure her that she belonged. A part of me, the part that had become increasingly cynical and bitter post-election, thought, \u003Cem\u003Ehow easy it is to make an overture when you have so little at stake\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut that wasn\u2019t entirely fair. I knew nothing of these girls\u2019 lives, and at least it was a kind overture. In considering their words, shouldn\u2019t I also consider Murfreesboro\u2019s history as a former flashpoint of Islamophobia? The girls were well-intentioned, and as a YA author, I was here to inspire, not chastise. And, given the fleeting nature of our interaction, was there a good way to tell them that their words stung more than eased? How could I explain that their statement of goodwill had sent me reeling, opening up a wound I myself didn\u2019t quite comprehend?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESo I did what I believed to be the right thing, the best thing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI smiled.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cThank you,\u201d I said. \u201cThat means a lot.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the girls walked away, I was still smiling, but my heart was aching, for me, for them, for Murfreesboro, for the country we all called home.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv class='ctx-subscribe-container ctx-personalization-container ctx_default_placement ctx-clearfix'\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class='ctx-social-container ctx_default_placement ctx-clearfix'\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cdiv class='ctx-module-container ctx_default_placement ctx-clearfix'\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\u003Cspan class=\"ctx-article-root\"\u003E\u003C!-- --\u003E\u003C/span\u003E","title":"A Muslim YA Author on Belonging at a Tennessee Book Festival"},{"feed_item_id":2609115388,"published_at":1494841472,"created_at":1494843111,"version_key":1494843111,"updated_at":1494843111,"starred":false,"read":false,"read_later":false,"author":"Kyle Lucia Wu","feed_id":374711,"feed_name":"Literary  Hub","url":"http://lithub.com/a-literary-party-institution-both-cheeky-and-sacred/","body":"\u003Cimg width=\"768\" height=\"512\" src=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355-768x512.jpg\" class=\"attachment-medium_large size-medium_large wp-post-image\" alt=\"\" style=\"float:left; margin:0 15px 15px 0;\" srcset=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355-768x512.jpg 768w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355-300x200.jpg 300w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355-1240x827.jpg 1240w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 768px) 100vw, 768px\" data-attachment-id=\"66398\" data-permalink=\"http://lithub.com/a-literary-party-institution-both-cheeky-and-sacred/_mg_6355/\" data-orig-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"3000,2000\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Deb Ball\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355-300x200.jpg\" data-large-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/MG_6355-1240x827.jpg\" /\u003E\u003Cp\u003EThe One Story Debutante Ball is a revered institution in the literary party world. \u201cIt\u2019s \u003Cem\u003Efun\u003C/em\u003E,\u201d is commonly heard, or \u201cPeople actually dance!\u201d\u003Cb\u003E \u003C/b\u003E\u003Cem\u003EOne Story\u003C/em\u003E is celebrating its 15th anniversary this year, a milestone for a literary journal.

All the guests took the word \u201cball\u201d seriously, outfits a level up from cocktail attire. I saw \u003Cb\u003ERumaan Alam\u003C/b\u003E and asked if his kids had picked out his shoes, beginning our conversation as if his Twitter thread was a text message to me. I told him how his children are the only kids that make me want to have kids. \u201cYou know, other people have said that to me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey\u2019re like the poster children for children.\u201d \u003Cb\u003EMelissa Yancy\u003C/b\u003E, author of\u00a0\u003Cem\u003EDog Years,\u003C/em\u003E\u00a0was in from Los Angeles and\u00a0told me how she was published in Issue 20 of \u003Cem\u003EOne Story\u003C/em\u003E, back in 2003, and that long gap made this whole night feel even more special.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ENadxi Nieto\u003C/b\u003E was wearing a pleated yellow skirt and a\u00a0black t-shirt we all stroked upon realizing it was cashmere. She had just gotten back from a writing residency in Greece for three months, and she said the biggest difference was being around so many people\u2014she only had cats and sheep to talk to in Greece. \u003Cb\u003ELincoln Michel\u003C/b\u003E confirmed by later listing the names he\u2019d given all the cats that frequented their house. \u003Cb\u003EMolly McArdle\u003C/b\u003E was wearing a gold pendant of a Ram around her neck. \u201cAre you an Aries?\u201d I asked\u2014she wasn\u0026#8217;t. \u201cThe necklace is Aries,\u201d she explained, \u201cbut the outfit is very Libra.\u201d She gestured to her big fur jacket, blue jeans, and silk scarf draped around her collar; I really should have known.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EUp on stage, co-founder \u003Cb\u003EHannah Tinti \u003C/b\u003Ewas wearing fringe\u00a0worthy of Stevie Nicks, and playfully yelled, \u201cQuiet, debutantes in the back!\u201d before speaking about the importance of organizations that help cultivate that spark in an artist\u2019s life that is hopefully turned into a fire. The debutantes were announced, and as they made their way across the ballroom arm-in-arm with their mentors, the first line from each of their novels was read aloud. They each wore\u00a0corsages made of knitted flowers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cb\u003ELan Samantha Chang, \u003C/b\u003Eprogram director at the Iowa Writers\u0026#8217; Workshop,\u00a0was the 2017 Mentor of the Year, and she was given a lovely introduction by \u003Cb\u003EAngela Flournoy\u003C/b\u003E, who was\u00a0wearing\u00a0a killer black velvet jumpsuit. \u201cIn the future\u2014I still think there\u2019s going to be a future, guys\u2014I\u2019m already looking forward to bragging I was part of the Sam Chang era.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u201cI\u2019m going to give a talk,\u201d \u003Cb\u003ESam Chang\u003C/b\u003E opened, \u201cand no one told me exactly what to talk about. . . but I\u2019m going to talk about the importance of holding onto your inner life.\u201d As you would expect from the woman who has polished the most important writing program in the county, she soon had a room full of writers trying to memorize her every word:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 30px;\"\u003EWe are taught to believe that publication of a book is the happy ending to a long journey of working and striving, but. . . publishing is only the beginning of the quest. The quest requires learning to navigate the world as a public writer, which is the opposite of making art. It also requires learning to guard that inner self from which the art emerged in the first place. Suddenly, the newly minted writer must make laborious efforts to describe what he or she has written. Some read history and theory and science in an effort to find vocabulary that will illuminate their creations. This struggle takes place, I think, because the sincere reaction to meaningful making art is often speechlessness. We make art about what we cannot understand through any other method. The finished product is like a pearl, complete and beautiful but mute about itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt took a moment for everyone to gather themselves. \u201cThat was the realest,\u201d I heard, and someone else murmured, \u201cI needed that.\u201d But leave it to \u003Cb\u003ECatherine LaSota\u003C/b\u003E, the great initiator of the dance floor, hair pointing toward the ceiling, battle-ready in intense eyeshadow: she soon got the stage filled. \u003Cb\u003EErin Wicks\u003C/b\u003E\u00a0of HarperPerennial was dancing in a long red dress and\u00a0I asked her who she would have liked to present as an editor. She answered \u003Cb\u003ESarah Gerard\u003C/b\u003E: \u201cI know she\u2019d get down hard with me on the dance floor, and also because I love her book.\u201d I saw \u003Cb\u003EAngela Flournoy\u003C/b\u003E and she spoke to me about Sam Chang. \u201cWhat I admire so much about Sam Chang is the way that she quietly, but very doggedly, changed the culture of the workshop. Eventually, that will change the literary landscape. She made it not just more diverse, but also a place where you don\u2019t have to feel like everything is a competition. It wasn\u0026#8217;t somebody that made you feel like you were on a reality show competing for one slot.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs the night wound down, I chatted with \u003Cb\u003EJulie Buntin\u003C/b\u003E and \u003Cb\u003EJulia Pierpont\u003C/b\u003E to the side of the stage before leaving. \u201cWhere\u2019s my date?\u201d \u003Cb\u003ERachel Fershleiser\u003C/b\u003E yelled, before finding Julie and folding\u00a0her into a hug. \u201cRachel has been encouraging me since before I thought I was a writer,\u201d Julie said. That\u2019s the most important, we agreed, that nascent encouragement before you\u2019re even close to believing it yourself. And maybe \u003Ci\u003Ethat\u2019s \u003C/i\u003Ewhy \u003Cem\u003EOne Story\u003C/em\u003E is so precious, not because it\u2019s Brooklyn, not because people dance, but because it\u2019s an entire night constructed around that: the idea of encouraging a young writer before they have anything real to give you, before you can articulate why.\u003C/p\u003E\n\n\u003Ca

visitable past\u2014in the nearer distances and the clearer mysteries, the marks and signs of a world we may reach over to as by making a long arm we grasp an object at the other end of our own table. The table is the one, the common expanse, and where we lean, so stretching, we find it firm and continuous. That, to my imagination, is the past fragrant of all, or of almost all, the poetry of the thing outlived and lost and gone, and yet in which the precious element of closeness, telling so of connections but tasting so of differences, remains appreciable.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EWe are divided, of course, between liking to feel the past strange and liking to feel it familiar; the difficulty is, for intensity, to catch it at the moment when the scales of the balance hang with the right evenness.\u003C/em\u003E\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThat\u2019s Henry James in the preface to \u003Cem\u003EThe Aspern Papers\u003C/em\u003E, a story about a literary critic\u2019s Venetian quest to acquire a dead poet\u2019s papers. This story doesn\u2019t have a lot in common with James\u2019s, but they are both ghost stories, with ghosts who don\u2019t so much haunt the proceedings as hover just out of reach. As with James\u2019s poet, Jeffrey Aspern, you will not meet Dylan Thomas in this story, nor hear his poems. As with James\u2019s poet, Dylan is dead right from the start. But his afterlife does not exist without the poetry.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EJames\u2019s idea of a past we can visit as readily as reaching resonates with my work as director of the Unterberg Poetry Center of New York\u2019s 92nd Street Y, only it\u2019s not a table that is the common expanse, firm and continuous, but a stage in a concert hall where for nine decades the finest dancers, musicians and writers have performed and where, if they are lucky, artist and audience grow old together. Looking up from the floorboards at stage center, one sees inscriptions of 19\u00a0names in gold leaf, figures of cultural memory\u2014among them Moses, Isaiah, Homer, Virgil, Washington, Lincoln, Beethoven, Bach, Shakespeare, Dante and Goethe\u2014which, like Petrarch\u2019s laurels, crown the heads of artist and audience alike in a canonical tradition established over thousands of years, the Bible and American history on one hand, philosophy, classical music and poetry on the other.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESince 1930, when the hall was built, only one of the 19\u00a0names has been swapped\u2014Einstein in, Aristotle out\u2014but no local canon can be fully trusted, certainly not one without women and Mozart. Perhaps our forefathers simply ran out of room, and that\u2019s largely the point. \u201cCultural memory is defined by a notorious shortage of space,\u201d writes Aleida Assman. \u201cWhatever makes it into active memory has passed rigorous processes of selection. The canon outlives generations.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EEinstein, who died in 1955, is the youngest to be inducted into the hall\u2019s golden crown of names, and no one is suggesting that Dylan replace Dante. But since his tragic death, in 1953 in New York, at the age of 39, on the fourth and final of his Poetry Center-sponsored reading tours, Dylan Thomas has perhaps moved closer than any poet since Yeats to a kind of secular canonization and to becoming, in his home country of Wales, a national poet and cultural saint. Here on the day after the third-annual Dylan Day, a literary holiday created by the Welsh in the commemorative momentum of the poet\u2019s 2014 centenary, I\u2019d like to explore this idea\u2014what it is, how it happened and what it means. Cultural canonization\u2014the social construction of immortality\u2014is \u201cmeant to be a suggestive concept,\u201d write Marijan Dovic and Jon Karl Helgason in their new study, \u003Cem\u003ENational Poets, Cultural Saints\u003C/em\u003E. \u201cIt allows for a simultaneous focus both on the cultural saints and those who manage their afterlives.\u201d Since producing celebrations of Dylan\u2019s centenary in 2014, I have become fascinated by the story of his afterlife and its stewardship in the last six decades, both at the Y and in Wales.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EDovic and Helgason\u2019s new study expands on their contributions to the anthology \u003Cem\u003ECommemorating Writers in 19th-century Europe\u003C/em\u003E, whose editors, Joep Leersen and Ann Rigney, argue that:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EThe resolutely textual focus of traditional literary scholarship has meant very little critical attention has been paid until recently to these extraordinary performances and materializations of literary enthusiasm in the public sphere. But with the recent broadening of the scope of scholarship to processes of reception and to the \u2018social lives of texts,\u2019 the full scale of their importance emerges: they indicate that canonicity is not merely a matter of which books are kept on the bookshelves, but also a matter of the way people give shape to their collective identities and allegiances in a public way. The picture which emerges is one of a complex interaction between the embodied and the imagined experience of communities, between the local and the national celebration of a common figure and between the different localities participating in the same cult.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe anthology looks at the public literary celebrations of Schiller and Burns, Walter Scott, Dante, Voltaire, Pushkin, Cervantes, and Shakespeare, among others, and defines cult as \u201ca pattern of ritual behavior in connection with specific objects within a framework of spatial and temporal coordinates [with] some degree of recurrence in place and repetition over time of ritual action.\u201d The 92nd Street Y, it turns out, is one of the founding sites of the Dylan Thomas cult, together with the city of Swansea, where Dylan was born and raised, writing the poems that made his name in the literary circles of 1930s London; and the town of Laugharne, where he is buried in St. Martin\u2019s cemetery and where he lived with his wife Caitlin and three children the last four years of his life, composing \u201cOver St. John\u2019s Hill,\u201d \u201cDo Not Go Gentle,\u201d \u201cPoem on His Birthday\u201d and most of \u003Cem\u003EUnder Milk Wood\u003C/em\u003E in a writing shed looking out across the Taf Estuary.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt was John Malcolm Brinnin, my long-ago predecessor as director of the Poetry Center from 1949 to the mid-1950s, who first brought Dylan to America. The first thing Brinnin did after he was hired, now that he had institutional backing, was invite Dylan to read at the Y. Dylan had been hoping to come to the States since the end of World War II, but he said he would need a number of paid gigs to make the trip worthwhile. In 1949 he was little known in America beyond literary circles, and Brinnin struggled to find a booking agent who would take him on. In an exchange that would forever alter both men\u2019s lives, Dylan accepted Brinnin\u2019s offer to plan the tour himself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\"caption\"\u003E\u003Cimg data-attachment-id=\"66209\" data-permalink=\"http://lithub.com/the-canonization-of-dylan-thomas/john-malcolm-brinnin-and-dylan-thomas-at-gotham-book-mart-by-g-d-hackett-1952/\" data-orig-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"1824,1511\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"John Malcolm Brinnin and Dylan Thomas at Gotham Book Mart\u0026#8211;by G.D.Hackett 1952\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952-300x249.jpg\" data-large-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952-1236x1024.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-66209\" src=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952-1236x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"600\" height=\"497\" srcset=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952-1236x1024.jpg 1236w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952-300x249.jpg 300w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/John-Malcolm-Brinnin-and-Dylan-Thomas-at-Gotham-Book-Mart-by-G.D.Hackett-1952-768x636.jpg 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px\" /\u003E John Malcolm Brinnin and Dylan Thomas at Gotham Book Mart.

Two days after Dylan\u2019s death, sculptor David Slivka had snuck into a Manhattan funeral home to make a mask of Dylan\u2019s face and head. \u201cI knew the beauty of that head,\u201d Slivka later said. He felt a need to preserve his friend\u2019s visage, as had been done with Keats, Dante and Goethe. He made a five-piece mold and then from a plaster cast created a bronze bust of Dylan that he left on the terrace of his West Village apartment for the next ten years.

Here is how Sheen introduced that Sunday-afternoon performance, whose crowd included some patrons who\u2019d attended the play\u2019s 1953 premiere.

On the day of the shoot, with an actor on stage impersonating Dylan, hundreds of Poetry Center subscribers were invited to dress up in vintage outfits, sit in the audience and play 1950s versions of themselves. \u201cMemorials of writers and national poets in particular have regularly functioned as sacred places where various forms of rituals\u2014pilgrimages, centenaries, annual festivities, processions, wreaths, proclamations\u2014were performed,\u201d write Dovic and Helgason. \u201cThese memorials provide a spatial framework for the evolving cult of cultural saints, enabling many people to express their loyalties by participating in collective rites.\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn 1982, when Dylan was inducted into Westminster Abbey\u2019s Poets\u2019 Corner, Brinnin was there and filed this report for \u003Cem\u003EThe New Yorker\u003C/em\u003E:\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EWelcoming the gathering of some 1500 or so, the Dean of Westminster provided a fact that did not seem entirely pertinent,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhile Keats, Shelley and Byron each had to wait almost a hundred years to be honored with a stone at Poets\u2019 Corner, Browning and Tennyson came by theirs almost instantaneously.

As I brought my index finger to within an inch of hers, she took hold, tightened her grip, and would not let go until the man, shifting the weight of her to his other shoulder, turned around. \u2018This is Dylan\u2019s granddaughter,\u2019 he said. \u2018Her name is Hannah.\u2019\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\"caption\"\u003E\u003Cimg data-attachment-id=\"66270\" data-permalink=\"http://lithub.com/the-canonization-of-dylan-thomas/aeronwy-thomas-at-poets-corner-stone-unveiling-march-1-1982/\" data-orig-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982.jpg\" data-orig-size=\"760,1086\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\u0026quot;aperture\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;credit\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;camera\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;caption\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;created_timestamp\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;copyright\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;focal_length\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;iso\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;shutter_speed\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;title\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;\u0026quot;,\u0026quot;orientation\u0026quot;:\u0026quot;0\u0026quot;}\" data-image-title=\"Aeronwy Thomas at Poets\u0026#8217; Corner Stone Unveiling\u0026#8211;March 1, 1982\" data-image-description=\"\" data-medium-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982-210x300.jpg\" data-large-file=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982-717x1024.jpg\" class=\"wp-image-66270\" src=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982-717x1024.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"437\" height=\"624\" srcset=\"http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982-717x1024.jpg 717w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982-210x300.jpg 210w, http://16411-presscdn-0-65.pagely.netdna-cdn.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/05/Aeronwy-Thomas-at-Poets-Corner-Stone-Unveiling-March-1-1982.jpg 760w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 437px) 100vw, 437px\" /\u003E Aeronwy Thomas at Poets\u0026#8217; Corner Stone Unveiling\u0026#8211;March 1, 1982\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E*\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ELike Petrarch\u2019s Arqua, Shakespeare\u2019s Stratford and Jane Austen\u2019s Chawton, Dylan\u2019s Swansea and Laugharne are central to the cult that has emerged in the six decades since his death. In Laugharne, pilgrims visit Dylan\u2019s grave, his boathouse, writing shed, and favorite pubs. They take walking tours of natural sites that inspired him all his life in southwest Wales.

Unless it\u2019s something more like wishful thinking: a desire to manifest a Dylan who did not die young. What laurels would Dylan the elder have received? Here is one idea.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EDylan Thomas, at the age of\u00a073, stands well within the company of the great poets. He is still writing, and the poems which now appear, usually embedded in short plays or set into the commentary and prefaces which have been another preoccupation of his later years, are, in many instances, as vigorous and as subtle as the poems written by him during the years ordinarily considered to be the period of a poet\u2019s maturity.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EThe early Thomas was, in many ways, a youth of his time: a romantic exile seeking, away from reality, the landscape of his dreams. By degrees\u2014for the development took place over a long period of years\u2014this partial personality was absorbed into a man whose power to act in the real world and endure the results of action (responsibility the romantic hesitates to assume) was immense. Thomas advanced into the world he once shunned, but in dealing with it he did not yield to its standards. That difficult balance, almost impossible to strike, between the artist\u2019s austerity and \u201cthe reveries of the common heart\u201d\u2014between the proud passions, the proud intellect and consuming action\u2014he finally attained and held to.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003EIn age, he shows no impoverishment of spirit or weakening of intention. He answers current dogmatists with words edged with the same contempt for \u201cthe rigid world\u201d of materialism that he used in youth. He is now content to throw out suggestions that are not, perhaps, for our age to complete, as it is not for our age fully to appreciate a man who reiterates: \u201cIf we have not the desire of artistic perfection for an art, the deluge of incoherence, vulgarity, and triviality will pass over our heads.\u201d Adherence to that creed, and that creed alone, has given us the greatest poet writing in English today.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThese are the words of Louise Bogan, whose poems Dylan used to read as part of his public performances at places like the Y. Dylan enjoyed performing others\u2019 poems more than his own. He wrote them out longhand to learn their music and embody them with his voice. Bogan is not writing about Dylan, though. She is writing about Yeats. Her essay of appreciation was published in 1938, when Yeats turned 73. He died a year later, in 1939.

This was a twofold symbol. The most trivial places of communist society would henceforth be as luxurious as the palaces of the bourgeoisie. But above all, the working class would be relieved of the very incarnation of human rapacity\u2014that accursed money, whose connections with anality had been underlined by Freud. Socialism would outdo capitalism at the same time that it disqualified it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA piquant detail: in 2013, the American celebrity Kim Kardashian and her husband, the rapper Kanye West, had gold-plated toilets installed in their house in Los Angeles at the modest cost of just over half a million dollars. $550,000. Lenin had been heard, though not necessarily by those whom he had addressed.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoney is one of those things that seem obvious but aren\u2019t. It is truly the commoner of life, as crude as it is burdensome. It seems to go without saying but remains a mystery in broad daylight. The French word for money (\u201cargent\u201d) is marvelously ambiguous: it also stands for the silver long used to make coins. Nothing can be said about money without asserting the contrary: that it is vulgar and noble, fiction and reality. It separates and connects people; it frightens us when there is a lot of it and frightens us when there is a lack of it. It\u2019s a good that does evil, an evil that does good.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe first coins, historians tell us, date from the third millennium BCE\u00a0in Ur, and were struck with the image of Ishtar, the goddess of fertility and death, a curious duality. Money is the universal pidgin par excellence, comprehensible everywhere; anyone can manipulate it, no matter what his language or religion; everyone can convert it instantaneously, in the depths of the desert as well as in the most remote islands.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoney implies, first of all, confidence. In Rome, the first coins were connected with their owners and the credit they enjoyed. Today, disconnected from the gold standard, their value varies with the economic health of the nations that issue them. They are imbued with an aura of sacredness, because they incarnate a people or a precise community. Money features in two kinds of stories: those of the oppressors who crush the forsaken by financial means, and those of the oppressed who free themselves thanks to financial independence. In one case, it is a power that enslaves; in the other, a force that liberates. That is its ambiguity: when it is condemned, we want to defend it; when it is defended we want to attack it. Like sex, it is overflowing with meaning, giving rise to countless synonyms that never really designate what it is: bread, lettuce, gravy, jack, loot, moola, scratch, portraits of dead presidents. And this is true in all languages.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u0026#8220;Like sex, money\u00a0is overflowing with meaning, giving rise to countless synonyms that never really designate what it is.\u0026#8221;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIt is not only a unit of exchange and a receptacle of value, but above all a barometer of our desires. The measure of all passions, it has become the absolute passion in which all the others are reflected. Contrary to the commonplace about its making the world uniform, we have colored it with our many affects. The vices with which it is associated\u2014cupidity, envy, avarice\u2014existed before it, but in each case it seems to amplify them. The enthusiasms as well as repulsions that it arouses are themselves symptomatic. What is fascinating about it is its status as a creation that has escaped its creator\u2019s grasp and turned on him, a discreet offshoot turned into a mad tyrant.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo talk about money is always to talk about oneself. I was spared the injury of poverty; after a difficult youth my parents achieved a degree of affluence before sinking into debt. They began to count their pennies, and endured the bitterness of losing their social status. Death came to them when they were in a state of near destitution. So far as I was concerned, I moved from a careless indigence while I was a student to an intermittent prosperity. For a long time, I didn\u2019t worry about money, certain that luck would always be generous to me, and that the royalties derived from my writing were not a salary but a gift. Money offers the only truly precious value in this world: time, its inexhaustible abundance. In this respect it is liberating. When money is lacking, life is reduced to an eternal present that incarcerates us. I have always distinguished between my job and the reasons for existing. The two have sometimes coincided, but for all that without relieving me of the necessity of earning a living.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI recall with nostalgia that period; it was a time, lasting until I was in my forties, in which I considered money negligible. If there was some, that was good; if there was none, one got along. A marvelous nonchalance allowed me to consider material problems unimportant so long as I could explore the world, broaden my horizons, escape platitudes. It was a happy youth that lasted a long time, when the dividing line ran not between the necessary and the superfluous, but between the necessary and the essential. Among the essentials: the mysticism of the book, travel to Asia and India, feverish discussions, political commitments, demanding friendships, unusual experiences, multiple love affairs, and especially the opportunity to live my passion for writing.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EI like to think that money became a concern only with age, with the fear of not having enough of it in a society that has made it its center, with the end of the lyrical years and the Cold War, in the wake of the Thatcher and Reagan conservative revolution that forced Western culture to sober up and shift to more materialistic celebrations of tangible reality. It is a shift that is fading as we see once again different worldviews coming into violent confrontation. Getting old means slipping into the order of calculation, into the order of the account balance. Everything becomes limited for us, days number fewer. Time is no longer a profusion, it becomes a reprimand. For me, however, the supreme luxury, even today, is not to own beautiful cars, big apartments, or vacation homes, but rather to be able to prolong the student life into an advanced age. A student\u2019s life is one of daily improvisation, a taste for wandering the streets, long hours in a cafe, a flaunted detachment, indifference to honors and emoluments, and the symbolic trinkets with which people like to deck themselves to ward off the passing years. In sum, it is the absurd but necessary illusion of beginning a new life every morning. In such a life, if I feel privileged, it\u2019s because I have invented that privilege for myself. Being neither the heir to a fortune nor a financier, I have never been rich enough to forget money or poor enough to neglect it.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMoney is therefore a promise in search of wisdom. This should be understood in two senses: it is wise to have money, and wise to reflect critically on it. Money forces us constantly to arbitrate between our desires, our assets, and our debts. It makes everyone a philosopher in spite of himself: thinking well is also learning to spend well, for oneself and for others. Money is revealing: it exposes the tightwad and the profligate, the miserly and the envious, all betrayed by how they reach into their pockets. No one is at ease with money. Those who believe they detest it secretly worship it. Those who worship it overestimate it. Those who pretend to despise it are lying to themselves.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA problematic passion, an impossible condemnation. That is the difficulty.

Just an hour or so by train from London to the Sussex coast, a town of burnt down piers and dirty weekend hotels. It\u2019s home to early rising commuters and transient bed-sitters; hopeful gentrifiers and desperate homeless; relocated Londoners in need of fresh air and newly arrived immigrants looking for seasonal work; weekend ravers on Ecstasy and family day-trippers down from \u201cThe Smoke\u201d for a sliver of sunshine and a stick of rock. Everyone knows that 1960s Bank Holiday weekends were when the Mods on their Lambrettas and Vespas followed the Rockers on their BSAs and Triumphs to Brighton\u2014the Rockers drank the town dry while the Mods dropped Blackbombers and Purple Hearts in the Frothy Coffee shops (it took England some time to ask for a \u201ccappuccino\u201d). They then passed the time battling it out along the sea front sending sunbathing families scattering under a hail of wooden deckchairs and flying beer bottles. Go back a bit further and you might think of Brighton as a town of (probably fixed) horse races, illegal betting and razor gangs; a town run by the Italian Sabini gang who brought their organized crime outfit down from London to the seaside.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd that\u2019s usually where Brighton as a crime city starts for readers\u2014\u003Cstrong\u003EGraham Greene\u003C/strong\u003E\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EBrighton Rock\u003C/em\u003E, published in 1938 and described by the author himself as \u0026#8220;an entertainment.\u0026#8221; And it is . . . if your kind of entertainment is wildly slashing razor gangs and revenge killings. \u003Cem\u003EBrighton Rock\u003C/em\u003E isn\u2019t quite a True Crime book, but it was inspired by real events as the local razor gangs battled for supremacy of the town\u2019s betting trade. Greene\u2019s gang boss Colleoni is a very thinly disguised portrait of Charles \u201cDerby\u201d Sabini, a Brighton resident since the 1920s, boss of the Sabini mob, and the notorious \u0026#8220;King of the Racecourse Gangs.\u0026#8221;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe image of the town Greene presented in \u003Cem\u003EBrighton Rock\u003C/em\u003E has never quite been shaken off, much to the chagrin of Brighton\u2019s local politicians. The image persists\u2014perpetuated first by Richard Attenborough\u2019s unnerving performance as the young psycho Pinkie in the 1947 movie version of \u003Cem\u003EBrighton Rock\u003C/em\u003E (scripted by Greene with Terence Rattigan) and then again in Rowan Joff\u00e9\u2019s 2010 remake with Sam Riley bringing new menace to the story, reprising Attenborough\u2019s Pinkie, but relocating the story from the \u0026#8220;Spiv\u0026#8221; culture of the 1940s to the Mods of the 1960s.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETalking of Greene, there is a scene in the 1999 \u003Cstrong\u003ENeil Jordan\u003C/strong\u003E movie version of Greene\u2019s 1951 novel \u003Cem\u003EThe End of the Affair\u003C/em\u003E (that isn\u2019t in the book) of a man, in a Brighton hotel, surreptitiously staging an affair in order to obtain a divorce from his wife. Brighton was always a town where illicit lovers weekended; Britain\u2019s stern marriage laws allowed a couple to divorce if the husband was \u201ccaught\u201d with a female (not his wife) in a bedroom. All that was needed to secure the divorce was a witness (invariably a paid-off hotel maid). Brighton was the most popular destination for these staged liaisons. Greene\u2019s seedy vision of Brighton has stuck fast in the British public imagination\u2014no matter how many beach raves, Gay Pride festivals, vintage car rallies or other alternatives the local tourism promotion board offers visitors.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EGreene\u2019s vision of Brighton as a haven for the criminal and the marginal has continued to grip crime writers\u2019 imaginations. Brighton-born \u003Cstrong\u003EDanny Miller\u003C/strong\u003E\u2019s 2011 \u003Cem\u003EKiss Me Quick\u003C/em\u003E (which for non-Brits is a famous seaside slogan printed on cheap hats) is the first in his Vince Treadwell series. It\u2019s set in 1964 Brighton amid the battling Mods and Rockers with plenty of the sort of Brighton Greene would have felt at home in\u2014illicit porno flicks, Corsican pimps down from London, drugs, police corruption and a dead girl. \u003Cem\u003EKiss Me Quick\u003C/em\u003E delves into the bars, nightclubs, dirty weekend hotels and gambling joints of the town\u2019s legendary past. In later books Miller has Treadwell move on from Brighton\u2014first to Swinging 1960s London in \u003Cem\u003EThe Gilded Edge\u003C/em\u003E (2012) and then to the sexy, suntanned French Riviera (well, nobody ever went to Brighton to get a serious tan!) in \u003Cem\u003EExit The Thief\u003C/em\u003E (2014).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnother local Brighton writer, \u003Cstrong\u003EElly Griffith\u003C/strong\u003E, has also been successfully mining the Brighton of Greeneland. \u003Cem\u003EThe Zig Zag Girl\u003C/em\u003E (2014) brings together the unlikely pairing of Detective Inspector Edgar Stephens and slightly past-it seaside vaudeville magician Max Mephisto to solve a murder in 1950s Brighton. The pair team up again in \u003Cem\u003ESmoke and Mirrors\u003C/em\u003E (2015) when two kids go missing after a second-rate pantomime. They don\u2019t get much of a breather before they have to confront an anarchist plot to bomb the pier in \u003Cem\u003EThe Blood Card\u003C/em\u003E (2016) and then there\u2019s a dead dancer from a nude tableau show (a form of entertainment that\u2019s just so very 1950s Brighton!) in \u003Cem\u003EThe Vanishing Box\u003C/em\u003E (2017). Each of the Stephens and Mephisto novels conjure (forgive the pun) the slightly down-at-heel post-war Brighton world of cheap end-of-the-pier entertainment shows, mouldering lodging houses that reek of the chip pan and smoky pubs serving warm beer.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut surely Brighton\u2019s changed, I hear you cry? Gentrification, the Commuter Belt, the \u0026#8220;Gay Capital of Britain\u0026#8221;, student ravers? Well, reading the local crime fiction, yes and no; same but different would seem to be the best answer. The King of Brighton crime nowadays is undoubtedly \u003Cstrong\u003EPeter James\u003C/strong\u003E. James has sold about as many books in his phenomenally popular Detective Superintendent Roy Grace series as there are pebbles on Brighton Beach and\u2014as anyone who\u2019s ever tried to stretch out in the sun and get comfortable on that beach will tell you\u2014that\u2019s a lot of pebbles. Every one of the 13\u00a0(certainly not an unlucky number for James\u2014he\u2019s sold 18 million copies and counting worldwide so far) Roy Grace novels has the word \u201cdead\u201d in the title giving you an idea of the content.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut though they\u2019re murder mysteries the Roy Grace series is firmly set in the Brighton of now\u2014drugs, undocumented\u00a0immigrants, hit-and-run killings, gambling debts, philandering husbands. James himself was born in Brighton and was writing thrillers set here, there and everywhere. Then one day a former Chief Constable in the city\u2019s police (just to confuse things Brighton was always a town until it was re-designated a city in 2001) told him that Brighton was the favored place to live in the UK for \u201cFirst Division Criminals.\u201d That opened a whole world of possibilities and Roy Grace confronts most of them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith Roy Grace being such a big seller, and James\u2019s new novels regularly entering the book charts at number one on the strength of pre-sales alone, it\u2019s amazing he hasn\u2019t appeared on our TV screens so far. And yet it hasn\u2019t happened, despite rumors of everyone from Steve Coogan (who played it straight in 2013\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EPhilomena,\u003C/em\u003E but is best known in the UK as a comedy actor) to Hugh Bonneville (the stiff upper lipped Lord Grantham in \u003Cem\u003EDownton Abbey\u003C/em\u003E) being cast as the forty-something DS with Brighton Police. Grace fans await further news with baited breath. Though one thing everyone agrees on is that the show absolutely must be filmed in Brighton.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA couple of other Brighton crime novels (and a TV show) worth noting . . .\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp style=\"padding-left: 60px;\"\u003E\u003Cem\u003EThe Death of Bunny Munro\u003C/em\u003E (2009) by \u003Cstrong\u003ENick Cave\u003C/strong\u003E.

His Bunny Munro is a womanizing, alcoholic, failed salesman in early 2000s Brighton where a serial killer is on the loose (fiction) and the Victorian West Pier has just been destroyed in an awful fire (sadly, not fiction).

Plenty of Brighton tropes in this controversial novel that divided the critics when it was published. Bella, a sex worker, goes on a killing spree targeting men who abuse women\u2014man after man; murder after murder. No lesser commentator than Salman Rushdie hated it; no lesser feminist critic than Naomi Wolf loved it. Either way it was a best seller. Unfortunately just about everybody disliked the movie adaptation a couple of years later, directed by Michael Winner.

Mullan is amazing as the city\u2019s gang boss and, of course, the narrow Brighton \u201cLanes\u201d and seafront are suitably sleazy and filled with strip clubs, kebab shops, dark pubs and prowling minicabs. The trick in a gangster show of course is to humanize the monster (Tony Soprano as much as Jimmy Cagney) and Mullan, despite his trademark thick smog of menace and volatility, is also surprisingly vulnerable as the horrible disease takes control of him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThere\u2019s a direct line from \u003Cem\u003EBrighton Rock\u003C/em\u003E to \u003Cem\u003EThe Fear\u2014\u003C/em\u003Ea line that encompasses just about all crime writing associated with the city.

Since it was first published in 2014, after winning the Kwani Manuscript Project, the enthusiasm with which \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Ehas been received in Uganda has been difficult to describe but remarkable to witness. Last year, I had the pleasure of trailing behind Jennifer Nansubuga Makumbi at the Writivism literary festival in Kampala, as readers and other writers caught at the hem of her garment. In such circles, it is hard to overstate what a rock star she is, and how precious her\u00a0book has already become. The book sold out immediately, and even those who hadn\u2019t read it were talking about it and about where to get it. It\u2019s not hyperbole to call \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Ethe great Ugandan novel. It is, simply and obviously, a plain fact.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHer reception in the UK, where she lives with her family, has been very different. Even after winning the 2014 Commonwealth Short Story Prize, Makumbi was told that \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Ewas unpublishable, that it was much too African for British readers. Perhaps a sprawling multi-character saga like this one might work if the characters were white, if the proper nouns were places like Oxford or Southampton, and if their names were solid English names (and for goodness sake, only one name each!).\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn Great Britain, after all, who has even heard of Kintu, the mythical first man on earth and founder of the Buganda Kingdom? Who would know to pronounce his name with a soft \u003Cem\u003Ech \u003C/em\u003Esound, instead of a hard \u003Cem\u003Ek\u003C/em\u003E? Perhaps British readers might be interested in the exoticism of the historical novel that \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Estarts off as being\u2014the 90 pages or so that are set in the 18th century, before the rest of the novel reverts to 2004\u2014but could the book-buying public be expected to care about the struggles of an extended family in present-day Kampala?\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf you must write about Africa, then you write about dictators, ethnography, and war; these are the sorts of stories that confirm what people already \u201cknow\u201d about Africa. And if you must write about Uganda, then you place a white character in the middle of the action. You write about Africans who have left Africa and migrated to the United States or Europe. You write about the legacies of colonialism. If you can\u2019t make Europe the hero of the story\u2014and these days, you can\u2019t\u2014then you can at least make Europe the villain. One editor rejected the manuscript because Makumbi didn\u2019t want to change it: to publish it, they would have to change it, and the novel is too good to change.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u0026#8220;If you must write about Africa, then you write about dictators, ethnography, and war; these are the sorts of stories that confirm what people already \u0026#8216;know\u0026#8217; about Africa.\u0026#8221;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe main thing to know, simply, is that this novel was written for Ugandans. This might seem obvious, but it isn\u2019t. What, after all, is a Ugandan? For one thing, a Ugandan might be someone for whom complex and indefinite extended families are more the norm than the exception, a world in which siblings might be cousins, parents aren\u2019t always parents, and everybody can have at least three different names, depending on who they\u2019re standing next to. A Ugandan might be someone for whom family is a much older and more permanent institution than the nation, and in which nothing is more political than sex and children. A Ugandan might also be someone who knows the name Kintu, whether or not they know what it means. At the highest level of abstraction, perhaps, a Ugandan is someone with firm ideas about what it means to be Ugandan, and who it is that isn\u2019t. But if Uganda is real, its borders are anything but clear and obvious: American readers might struggle to keep track of the names and relations that proliferate across the pages of this novel, but it\u2019s not like these things are easy for Ugandans. They are not. If family is the texture of everyday life, then everyday life is as confusing and indefinite (and borderline fictional) as family history itself.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMore concretely, this book is for Ugandans because it\u2019s saturated with Ugandan words and places and names. From the hills and valleys that the urban jungle of Kampala now sprawls across\u2014but that once looked out over the Buganda Kingdom\u2014to the long roads and rivers that crisscross the country, \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eis a novel about a singular and all-encompassing sense of place. And these references tell stories. You may speed past them on your way to your destination, but even a traveler who cannot understand the language\u2014who can only look, see, and move on\u2014will still feel the depth of the novel\u2019s engagement with Ugandan history. This is part of \u003Cem\u003EKintu\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s magic: you will feel more than you know. This also applies to Ugandans, especially those for whom \u201chistory\u201d is the story of Europe in Africa.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAs Makumbi has been quick to explain, \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eflowed out of a desire to give Ugandans a taste of their own long and complicated history, to do for Ugandans something like what Chinua Achebe novels did for Nigerians in the 1960s: to make them look at a hill, for example, and know that the Ganda have been climbing it for centuries. To remind them that Uganda\u2019s history did not begin in 1962, when it gained independence from Great Britain, or even a few years earlier, when Europeans first \u201cdiscovered\u201d them. To place today\u2019s cultural politics\u2014of citizenship, sexuality, and spirituality\u2014into the deep and long endurance of centuries. Most of all, to tell a singular tale of Uganda as an expansive family saga, in which blood ties only mean as much as the stories we tell about them.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMakumbi began to write this story in 2003, in short bursts of frenetic, intense work that were followed by long fallow periods of distraction and contemplation. She was thinking about many things. One of them was a memory from her childhood, when she read Chinua Achebe\u2019s \u003Cem\u003EThings Fall Apart\u003C/em\u003E, in which a father kills his foster son. \u201cIt cut much too close!\u201d she told me. \u201cI was so young. I found myself looking at my father\u2019s hands and wondering, \u2018Would he kill me? Would he kill me?\u2019\u201d When her father lost his faculties, years later, she found herself dwelling on mental illness and the stereotype of Africa as a \u201cmad place.\u201d And when she began a PhD in African literature, in England, she became frustrated at the insistence of her supervisors that \u201cAfrican Literature\u201d be the story of Europe in Africa. As she began to write what she was then calling \u003Cem\u003EThe Kintu Saga\u003C/em\u003E, she vowed to tell the story of Uganda with colonialism placed in perspective: not to say that the colonial encounter wasn\u2019t important, but that it wasn\u2019t the only thing that was.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EA decade later, it\u2019s easy to find these biographical fragments in the final product. But as haunted as she might have been by Achebe\u2019s novels\u2014about a father who kills his son and a father who goes mad\u2014and as destructive as that legacy is, \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eis a response to \u003Cem\u003EThings Fall Apart \u003C/em\u003Ein which the story of a family curse is also a story of survivals. African literature is littered with patriarchal novels about how Africa\u2019s manhood was taken by Europe: it\u2019s one of Achebe\u2019s great themes. But while \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Emight be another story about men dying, it\u2019s also about families surviving (and often with women at the head). Makumbi insists that \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eis a \u201cmasculinist\u201d novel, and it is: focusing on the fragile edifice of paternity, she emphasizes the toll that patriarchy takes on the people who happen to be men. For that same reason, it\u2019s also one of the most feminist books one is likely to read. But when I asked her why she didn\u2019t call it \u201cfeminist,\u201d she laughed, and explained that I would have to wait and read what she was writing next. When I had, she said, I wouldn\u2019t have to ask; \u003Cem\u003Ethat \u003C/em\u003Ewould be feminist.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMakumbi is a scholar, and to write \u003Cem\u003EKintu\u003C/em\u003E, she dug into the archives, asking questions about names and places and expressions and history. But Ugandan history is filled with stories that the archive won\u2019t tell, places where the historical record suddenly goes silent. To tell that history, she had to become a fiction writer attuned to silences. After all, Uganda is a family, and \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eis the story of how all families are built out of silences and fictions: sometimes an uncle is really a father, or a cousin is really a brother; even mothers are never necessarily who you think they are. And sometimes the past separates us, and is better forgotten. \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eis about creating family ties where none existed before, about making homes and families that can reach across the gaps of time and space; it\u2019s also about making up new truths when the old ones are lost or inadequate. It\u2019s about journeying far away to find out where you are from.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u0026#8220;Ugandan history is filled with stories that the archive won\u2019t tell, places where the historical record suddenly goes silent.\u0026#8221;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETake, for example, the long opening journey that begins the first book, as Kintu Kidda and his men cross the \u003Cem\u003Eo \u003C/em\u003ELwera desert on their way to the capital of the Buganda Kingdom. For him, the journey takes many days of hard travel across a barren and forbidding landscape. The governor of a distant province, and of suspiciously non-Ganda ancestry, Kintu is loyal to the Ganda \u003Cem\u003Ekabaka\u003C/em\u003E, however far he is from the centers of courtly power. And so he must cross \u003Cem\u003Eo \u003C/em\u003ELwera to prove his allegiance; he must re-establish the links between the center and the periphery of the great Buganda Kingdom, must reassure the Ganda that he is part of it. As he travels\u2014as he contemplates his situation, remembering his past and planning his future\u2014we are immersed in his world, the courtly intrigues and domestic complications that consume him.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut we also follow him into the trials and tribulations of making family and nations out of strangers. Neither one is just \u003Cem\u003Ethere\u003C/em\u003E\u2014both must be made.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EKintu Kidda is fictional, but the \u003Cem\u003Eo \u003C/em\u003ELwera desert is as real as the Ganda. Even today, the phrase \u201c\u003Cem\u003EKulika o Lwera\u003C/em\u003E\u201d is a common greeting for travelers on their arrival in Kampala, a \u201cwell done!\u201d for surviving the journey across its barren wasteland. It\u2019s not so formidable now. When she was young, Makumbi told me, she never understood why people said \u003Cem\u003EKulika o Lwera \u003C/em\u003Eto new arrivals; it was just something you said. The phrase survives as a relic of a time before planes and railroads and paved roads, when the barren stretch of land to the south of Kampala was still a fearsome barrier for travelers on foot. If you are traveling to Kampala on Masaka road today, you could be done with this journey in an afternoon. But it was not so long ago that it would make sense to congratulate someone for having managed not to die while crossing it. The world was much bigger a short century or three ago.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EToday, the phrase has also taken on a new meaning: the over-burdened Masaka road is an accident trap, a graveyard for automobiles and unlucky travelers. On foot or in a car, \u003Cem\u003Eo \u003C/em\u003ELwera is\u00a0\u003Cem\u003Eo \u003C/em\u003ELwera. The historical resonance doesn\u2019t stop there: the road that a provincial governor might have taken to visit the capital in 1750 is the same road that Idi Amin\u2019s army took in the late 1970s when they set off to invade Tanzania and conquer a province that (he claimed) historically belonged to Uganda. It\u2019s the same road that Yoweri Museveni took, in the 1980s, when his army invaded Uganda from Tanzania, establishing himself as president until today (despite some who murmur that he is suspiciously Rwandan). It\u2019s the road that Rwandan refugees might take to Kampala, looking to find new lives in the capital, or the road they might take to return. And on arrival, they might all say the same thing, \u003Cem\u003EKulika o Lwera\u003C/em\u003E.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Erings with this sense of deep history, grounded in place while effortlessly leaping from past to present and to the past-in-the-present. It carries us from the courtly intrigue and sexual politics of the 18th century to the trials and tribulations of an extended family today, to the many and scattered descendants of the Kintu clan, united by a curse that may or may not be real and by the ghosts, stories, and memories that link them all together. Most of all, they are united by the place they all live in, the land that makes them all Ugandans, and the home to which they all strive to arrive.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESome of \u003Cem\u003EKintu\u003C/em\u003E\u2019s history is invented. Buddu province was not added to the Buganda Kingdom until later in the 1700s, for example, and Makumbi admits to moving a few landmarks to where the plot needed them to be. But then, \u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Eis not history, and even \u201chistory\u201d is not necessarily true. And this is also the point of \u003Cem\u003EKintu\u003C/em\u003E, where families are made as much by hiding the truth as by disclosing it; why tell a son, after all, that he\u2019s \u003Cem\u003Ereally \u003C/em\u003Eadopted? Why let it become true by saying the words? Indeed, this is the challenge of the historical novel: whether or not the stories are true might be the least important thing about them. History as it\u2019s written down in books is one thing, but history as it\u2019s \u003Cem\u003Elived \u003C/em\u003Eis another.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cspan class=\"pullquote\"\u003E\u0026#8220;On the ground, history is the accumulated prejudices, hopes, and superstitions that we carry even if we don\u2019t understand how we acquired them.\u0026#8221;\u003C/span\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Cem\u003EKintu \u003C/em\u003Ebelongs in the latter camp, and for good reason. When historians trained in Europe tell the story of Uganda, it\u2019s all about endings and beginnings, how Europe came and everything fell apart, or how independence came and colonialism fell apart; it\u2019s always the story of how the past recedes into the background as we race irrevocably forward. From that perspective, African history looks like a fast-moving train. \u201cTribalism\u201d fades as modernity looms on the horizon. But on the ground, history looks nothing like this clash of nations and empires and states, however true and valid such stories may be on their terms; on the ground, history is the accumulated prejudices, hopes, and superstitions that we carry even if we don\u2019t understand how we acquired them, everything we don\u2019t know that makes us who we are. History is a fabric of memories and fear and forgetting, of longing and nostalgia, of invention and re-creation. History is bunk, and sometimes it\u2019s a good thing it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis is \u003Cem\u003EKintu\u003C/em\u003E: the story of how the old pasts are forgotten sonthat new pasts, new families, and new nations can be remembered into existence.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat makes a Ugandan? A Ugandan might be someone who knows the story of Kintu, the mythological first man on earth, both the Adam of the Ganda creation story\u2014with Nnambi, his Eve\u2014and the legendary founder of the Buganda Kingdom. But as Makumbi explained to me, even this Kintu is already an ahistorical conflation, a Ganda-centric mythology placing that kingdom at the center of the world (and at the center of Uganda). At barely six or eight centuries old, the Buganda Kingdom is not \u003Cem\u003Equite \u003C/em\u003Eas old as the human race; we may safely presume that the human race is a bit older than that. More to the point, Uganda is a nation-state that includes vast stretches of terrain and populations whose ancestors never spoke Luganda, who found themselves inside the Buganda Kingdom due to the usual machinations of state-building and imperial politics.

The redemption of ugliness is in humor, of cruelty in charity, of suffering in consciousness and compassion. The movement of redemption is alwas from the mass, of fate or the way things unspeakably are, to the person, to individual acts of courage or conscience, to some individual realization that this, too \u2013 these tiny but volatile sparks of hope \u2013 is part of the way things are, part of what is given.

Yet a Yakov-Bellis identification is unavoidable. Moreover, it is a pertinent fact of history that while the crime of ritual murder was confirmed at the Bellis trial, Mendel Bellis was himself acquitted.

Many socialists still imagine that their primary work is to create a \u201cmass movement\u201d in which some badly understood \u201cWe\u201d emerges triumphant. Unfortunately, that is a vain and potentially bloody fantasy. Every mass knows that it is not alone and triumphant. There are always others, other masses.

The \u201cnot in my name\u201d response to \u003Cstrong\u003EGeorge W.

In a less theatrical example, we could even look\u00a0to the refusal of industrial agriculture through farmer\u2019s markets, farm-to-table programs, locavore consciousness, humane meat and egg production, etc. \u0026#8212; none of this waits until factory farming has been regulated out of existence by an enlightened central government.

And it doesn\u2019t merely wait for the arrival of the next neo-liberal wonk president. It is not concerned with the safe return of its \u201cfirst world\u201d privileges: the better jobs, the elite educations, the better access to consumer goods. To be reductive, it is not interested in maintaining bourgeois privilege at the expense of those living in America\u2019s rural or urban hinterlands, which was more or less what \u003Cstrong\u003EHillary Clinton\u003C/strong\u003E offered, what \u003Cstrong\u003EMoveOn\u003C/strong\u003E lobbies for, and what \u003Cstrong\u003EJerry Brown\u003C/strong\u003E seems so pleased about.

It works best when parties are fragmented and politicians have no choice but to stitch together majorities from inter-party coalitions. For Baker, this \u201cpractical democracy\u201d has an enviable record for progressive reform, \u00a0including labor law, social security, minority rights, etc. For example, the \u003Cstrong\u003EVoting Rights Act\u003C/strong\u003E was enacted by a Democratic president over the objections of southern Democrats and with the support of moderate Republicans.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIn an era of hyper-partisanship, Baker\u2019s ideal has appeal, even though it ignores the outsize influence of concentrated wealth on all factions. (His \u201cpractical democracy\u201d is merely collusion if the two parties are just arms of the one great Party of Wealth\u2026\u00a0as they are.) But perhaps what he is suggesting is a fourth fateful irony: democracy works best when it is not working democratically. Which is to suggest that the very idea of democracy is an empty talisman, a sort of gilded idol, behind which there are only myths and legends, piety, and the fear that if the fiction of democracy no longer stabilizes social discourse, some worse barbarity will take its place. (A not unreasonable fear, as that \u003Cem\u003Eenfant terrible \u003C/em\u003Eof fascist \u003Cem\u003Ehaute couture,\u003C/em\u003E \u003Cstrong\u003EMilo Yiannopoulos\u003C/strong\u003E, has flamboyantly dramatized for us.)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhat\u2019s missing in Baker\u2019s pragmatic rendering of political life in Washington is any suggestion that a similarly non-ideological pragmatism might succeed back home as well. Why should communities, cities, and states wait for centralized deal-making to get things done, especially when that deal-making always seems to benefit the wealthy first? While Congress dithers over whether or not people should be allowed to own AK-47s, let gun control be a local issue. If the people of Texas want to enjoy their assault weapons at the local shooting range, let \u2019em. And let them figure out what to do about the gun violence that comes along with the target shooting. Suicide, domestic violence, and massacres at the shopping mall are not subtle considerations, even for the bewildered people of the American Southwest.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EPersonally, I have no plans for visiting Texas again in this lifetime, unless I\u2019m airlifted into and out of Austin. The idea of the great state of Texas\u0026#8212;pickup paradise\u0026#8212;fills me with the same sort of dread that I feel at the thought of hiking among grizzly bears in Alaska: I don\u2019t belong there. And yet I am content to let Texans be Texans, God help them!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAnd if the people of the Pacific Northwest want to forbid AK-47s in order to better enjoy a world of bike trails, nature preserves, and local craft beverages, that should be fine too. That I know of, the \u003Cstrong\u003ESecond Amendmen\u003C/strong\u003Et has nothing to say on the right to own massacre machines, since the good old founding fathers were thinking about muzzle-loading rifles and pistols that couldn\u2019t shoot straight at thirty feet.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo a degree, I jest. But a good part of what I\u2019m suggesting is already the case: people are voting with their feet, and the consequences of this nomad democracy, this political economy for the wandering, are already familiar. The path these feet are following was pioneered in the 1960s when gay men from all over the country began moving to the \u003Cstrong\u003ECastro District\u003C/strong\u003E in San Francisco. What the gay community was creating was not just a safe place for gays to be who they were, but a new form of democratic action, an improvisatory democracy beyond democracy.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EMore recently, that path has been deepened through the legalization of marijuana in states like Washington and Colorado, where it\u2019s okay now for state laws to be federal scofflaws. Add to that the \u201cFight for 15\u201d minimum wage laws in states like California and cities like Seattle. Add to that the sanctuary city movement. Add to the sanctuary movement transgender rights legislation. Add to all of that state and local protection of the environment (as with California\u2019s aggressive CAFE standards) and progressive funding of recreation. Health care, too, is becoming an odd sort of state\u2019s rights issue: in San Francisco, the Healthy SF program mandates employer contributions to health care for restaurant workers. (Of course, the billionaire owners of the restaurants are pushing back some. As \u003Cstrong\u003ETilman Fertitta\u003C/strong\u003E, owner of Rainforest Caf\u00e9, has \u003Ca href=\"http://www.sfgate.com/food/article/Billionaire-behind-Rainforest-Cafe-and-Claim-10987596.php\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Ecommented\u003C/a\u003E, \u201cAll these states now are doing their own mandates. Why should the city of San Francisco be able to do absolutely whatever they want to do?\u201d)\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis trend is obvious, if not much commented on, and it will become increasingly normalized: go to a gun show in Texas; go to a coffee shop in Portland \u0026#8212; they\u2019re different countries. Soon, we\u2019ll be talking not about states rights, but about autonomous regions. A regime of supportive tolerance for such territorial differences should create, in time, ever-finer fragmentations of culture within progressive regions, assuming that people feel free to self-invent and assuming a prevailing atmosphere of benevolence. That is a big assumption, I grant you. But, hey, even NRA types might feel more benevolent if they did not also feel they were being coerced through federal regulation. Otherwise, as far as I\u2019m concerned, they\u2019re welcome to their misery.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EBut there are problems with this separatist logic.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe dark side of thinking of states and cities as autonomous regions is what it means for the economies and social conditions of southern and rural states, our so-called red states, by my count more than twenty-five\u00a0of the fifty\u00a0and 2/3 of the landmass. As \u003Cstrong\u003ERichard Florida\u003C/strong\u003E\u00a0argues in \u003Cem\u003EThe Rise of the Creative Class\u003C/em\u003E, national wealth is going to be in those places where employers think they can attract and keep skilled employees. That means places where there is art, cuisine, education, recreation, and some semblance of social justice. It is to such places that the best and the brightest from rural and rustbelt states are being drawn. If the obvious material benefits aren\u2019t sufficient reason to move, there is the unsubtle influence of teen television programs like \u201cThe OC\u201d and \u201cRiverdale,\u201d where indie bands like\u003Cstrong\u003E Death Cab for Cutie\u003C/strong\u003E advise, \u201cBe sure to wear some flowers in your hair!\u201d\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EHidden persuaders, indeed!\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u003Ca href=\"https://www.mhpbooks.com/books/we-robots/\" target=\"_blank\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"alignright wp-image-119292 size-medium\" src=\"https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-232x300.jpg\" width=\"232\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-232x300.jpg 232w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-135x175.jpg 135w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-320x414.jpg 320w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-116x150.jpg 116w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-97x126.jpg 97w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-218x282.jpg 218w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-408x528.jpg 408w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-450x582.jpg 450w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2015/08/We-Robots-white-572x740.jpg 572w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 232px) 100vw, 232px\" /\u003E\u003C/a\u003EThat\u2019s all fine \u201cif you\u2019re going to San Francisco,\u201d as\u003Cstrong\u003E Scott McKenzie\u003C/strong\u003E \u003Ca href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ENrmULWKbeM\" target=\"_blank\"\u003Esang\u003C/a\u003E, but the rest of the country will increasingly be about resource extraction, industrial agriculture, and \u201cright to work\u201d conditions where union-free factories offer low wages and high risks.

In other words, there is no guarantee that governments and corporations working within an informal coalition of progressive states are going to do business with states that make racism, sexism, and homophobia defining attributes of their home culture. If they do work with these regressive states, they may face boycotts from their more affluent consumer base \u0026#8212; as \u003Cstrong\u003EUber\u003C/strong\u003E learned the hard way following the first Trump immigration ban.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThe examples of such boycotting are many and increasing.

Seattle dumped its investments in Wells Fargo because it financed oil pipelines. Mammoth pension funds like \u003Cstrong\u003ECalPERS\u003C/strong\u003E are under increasing pressure to structure investment to accomplish political ends, especially divestment in oil and gas. Democrats in Sacramento are currently pushing legislation that would require CalPERS to divest from companies that work on Trump\u2019s Mexican wall. And most painfully for the right, its media heroes\u0026#8212;like \u003Cstrong\u003ERoger Ailes\u003C/strong\u003E, \u003Cstrong\u003EBill O\u2019Reilly\u003C/strong\u003E, and erstwhile TV star \u003Cstrong\u003EDonald Trump\u003C/strong\u003E\u0026#8212;face what are called \u201cad boycotts\u201d (directed by social media groups like #GrabYourWallet) because of their juvenile sexual predations.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ESuch market politics will be driven largely by the most affluent\u0026#8212;and progressive\u0026#8212;regions of the country for a simple reason: when they decide not to buy your products, it hurts and it hurts quickly. Many things are changing in these hypothetically united states, but cash flow still matters. When activists in California draw a Hitler mustache on your brand, it can quickly become a crisis requiring an immediate PR patch.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFinally, under the dismal heading \u201cThat\u2019s Totally Fucked Up,\u201d consider this ultimate verse in the Red State Blues: in many red states, Republican-controlled legislatures are passing laws inhibiting municipal \u201cHome Rule,\u201d the right of cities to pass laws and ordinances on issues like wage protection, fracking, and gun regulation. These \u201cstate preemption\u201d laws are being pushed by rightwing organizations like the \u003Cstrong\u003EKoch brothers\u003C/strong\u003E\u2019 American Legislative Exchange Council (or ALEC). In Florida, Senate Bill 1158, introduced in March of 2017, would preempt the \u201cregulation of matters relating to commerce, trade, and labor.\u201d A similar law prohibits the city of Durham, North Carolina, from enacting living wage laws. In other words, in the South, wages will be determined in the state capitol and dictated by corporate, not local, interests.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EObviously, such legislation is not going to be a problem for progressive states and cities. The state of California is not going to tell San Francisco how to manage its affairs. Rainforest Caf\u00e9 will get no support for its whining from Sacramento. Charlotte, on the other hand, is quite likely to receive instructions from Raleigh. Republican-dominated state legislatures will offer freedom not to their citizens, but to corporations, intensifying the hopelessness of workers.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EAn even larger problem, affecting red and blue states alike, is the fact that democratic improvisation is restrained by what is most obvious: at both the macro and micro level, what is possible has nothing to do with any sort of democracy. What is possible is determined by the abstraction of every human interest in \u003Cem\u003Emoney\u003C/em\u003E. While we wonder about what democracy should mean, the abstraction of money grinds on dictating constraints, chief among which is that abstraction of an abstraction, \u003Cem\u003Edebt\u003C/em\u003E. The meaning of debt is not that you owe money; debt\u2019s meaning is that money owns you.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWith money, of course, comes the truly disheartening world of work. For a majority of Americans, employment is either nonexistent, or insufficient to provide lasting stability. Worse, the work that is available, especially in the vast service sector, is more often than not punishingly unrewarding. This work feels not like \u201ceconomic opportunity,\u201d but like an expression of contempt. Even at the upper end of the pay scale, the possibilities for work are ever more narrow, as college students come to understand when they wonder how they\u2019ll pay back their tuition loans. If they don\u2019t go into STEM disciplines, or the legal\u00a0or medical professions, they rightly worry that they\u2019ll never get out from under debt. And, of course, going to med or law school doubles down on debt. Surely, some young people must feel now as if they\u2019ve been condemned to higher education.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ETo invoke \u003Cstrong\u003EFreud\u003C/strong\u003E again, but not for the last time, think of democratic improvisation as creative energy, and think of money as a hostile and punishing reality principle that restricts our freedom to improvise. The reality created through money requires the \u201crenunciation,\u201d to use Freud\u2019s word, of any dreams we might have of how it is we\u2019d like to live. What Freud called \u201csexual renunciation\u201d now extends to \u201ccultural privation,\u201d as he put it in \u003Cem\u003ECivilization and Its Discontents. \u003C/em\u003EWe might live differently if we weren\u2019t being constantly threatened by this all-consuming abstraction\u0026#8212;this Freudian \u201cshit\u201d\u0026#8212;money.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EWhether the name of the regime is Obama, Clinton, Trump, or Resistance, this is the future: two worlds, separate and unequal. But that does not say enough. We have become sadly insensitive to the ironies of this separation, and so a news story about income inequality can run beside an article about driverless freight trucks, and it will be as if there was no relation between the two. But make no mistake, those trucks are coming and their first cargo will be further immiseration for unemployed truck drivers. Marijuana will be legal on the enlightened west coast, but hundreds of forlorn people will die of opioid overdoses in Ohio. In San Francisco even the kitchen staff will have access to a wellness program, complete with free Zumba sessions and gala half-marathons, but the poor in Texas will be denied Medicaid in the name of freedom. But we should not be fooled: whether rich state or poor, blue or red, the game is the same: We find our fated places one way or another in the money system, the enemy of every dream, the dictatorship of every present.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003E\u0026nbsp;\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cdiv id=\"attachment_145854\" style=\"width: 210px\" class=\"wp-caption alignleft\"\u003E\u003Cimg class=\"size-medium wp-image-145854\" src=\"https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-200x300.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"200\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-200x300.jpg 200w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-117x175.jpg 117w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-768x1152.jpg 768w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-320x480.jpg 320w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-100x150.jpg 100w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-84x126.jpg 84w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-188x282.jpg 188w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-408x612.jpg 408w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-450x675.jpg 450w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926-572x858.jpg 572w, https://cdn2.mhpbooks.com/2017/05/Sigmund_Freud_1926.jpg 1600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 200px) 100vw, 200px\" /\u003E\u003Cp class=\"wp-caption-text\"\u003ESiggy played guitar.\u003C/p\u003E\u003C/div\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EThis essay\u0026#8212;on fateful ironies, cults and cultures, and democratic improvisation\u0026#8212;is an exercise in \u201cthinking.\u201d As Freud understood it, thinking is \u201can experimental action carried out with small amounts of energy, in the same way as a general shifts small figures about on a map before setting his large bodies of troops in motion.\u201d I\u2019m under no illusion that we will soon be able to move beyond national politics, beyond partisan ranting, beyond the implied or quite concrete threat of police violence, and certainly not beyond money. People of all political stripes will have no choice except to continue to work with the situation as it is.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003ENonetheless, there is great undeveloped potential for democratic improvisation, for a strategic independence from national reality and from capitalist reality, but first we must recognize this improvisatory independence as \u003Cem\u003Ewhat we want\u003C/em\u003E. As I\u2019ve argued, we are not unfamiliar with this independence, but there can and should be more of it. We need a culture of ever-larger tolerance for the impertinent and for those of independent will.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EIf Freud had one hope, it was the rueful, plaintive, yet simple wish for a civilization that is less unhappy, less \u201cdiscontented.\u201d It came to this for him: \u201cHuman beings should be allowed to enjoy more pleasure without guilt and without punishment.\u201d Similarly, we as individuals and communities should be allowed more freedom for self-creation and self-development, without guilt and without punishment.\u003C/p\u003E\n\u003Cp\u003EFor Freud, it was a good thing that human instinctual drives are accomplished in culture and not in the woods.
