But here&#x2019;s one thing that went right during it: A risk everyone worried about &#x2014; foreign election interference &#x2014; mostly failed.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">That showed what is possible when government officials and technology companies are laser focused on a problem, effectively coordinate and learn from their past mistakes.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://apnews.com/article/barr-no-widespread-election-fraud-b1f1488796c9a98c4b1a9061a6c7f49d\">false narrative</a> that the election was stolen, culminating in a mob attack on the U.S. Capitol, also pointed to the limits of those efforts. The Russians or the Chinese didn&#x2019;t delegitimize our election. We did it to ourselves.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Today, I want to explore the glass half-full view. The largely averted threat of foreign election meddling was a success that shouldn&#x2019;t be overlooked.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What went wrong the last time</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Let me first remind you what happened around the 2016 election. Russian <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\">hackers</a> pilfered documents from the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2016/12/13/us/politics/russia-hack-election-dnc.html\">Democratic National Committee</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/07/25/us/politics/russian-hacking-elections.html\">tried to muck around</a> with state election infrastructure. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/02/17/technology/indictment-russian-tech-facebook.html\">Digital propagandists</a> backed by the Russian government also fanned information on Facebook, Instagram, YouTube and elsewhere that sought to erode people&#x2019;s faith in voting or inflame social divisions.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Powerful American institutions &#x2014; notably local, state and federal government officials as well as large internet companies &#x2014; were slow to tackle the problem or had <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2018/11/14/technology/facebook-data-russia-election-racism.html\">initially dismissed it</a>. The effect of the hacking and trolling <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.lawfareblog.com/danger-overstating-impact-information-operations\">wasn&#x2019;t clear</a>, but the worry was that foreign governments would regularly seek to disrupt U.S. elections and that it would contribute to Americans&#x2019; lack of trust in our systems and with one another.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What happened in 2020</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Some foreign governments, including <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/politics/russia-election-interference-hacks.html\">Russia</a> and Iran, tried to disrupt our elections again, but it mostly didn&#x2019;t work. The same U.S. institutions and digital defenses that failed four years earlier largely held strong this time.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;The progress that was made between 2016 and 2020 was remarkable,&#x201D; said <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://graphika.com/team/camille-francois/\">Camille Fran&#xE7;ois</a>, chief innovation officer at Graphika, a firm that analyzes manipulation of social networks.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What changed in government and tech</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">One major shift after 2016 was that federal government officials and the state and local officials who run elections overcame initial mistrust to collaborate more effectively on voting threats. <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://fsi.stanford.edu/people/matt-masterson\">Matt Masterson</a>, who until recently was a senior adviser on election security for the Department of Homeland Security, said coordination was the biggest change that helped shore up digital defenses in election management systems.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;This is as good as the federal government has worked on any issue in my experience,&#x201D; Masterson said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">He also credited efforts in states, notably Georgia, that created <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/13/us/georgia-recount-presidential-election.html\">paper trails of ballots</a> that could be audited quickly and provide <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2020/11/04/1011648/livestream-vote-counts-are-here-to-stay/\">more visibility into the vote counting</a> to help increase people&#x2019;s trust in the election process.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The tech companies, Fran&#xE7;ois said, shifted to acknowledge their blind spots. For the first time, online powers including Facebook wrote policies specifically tackling foreign government meddling and put people in charge of stopping it. They also <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/05/technology/facebook-twitter-election.html\">made it harder for foreign trolls to use some of their 2016 tactics</a>, such as buying online advertisements to circulate divisive messages widely.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Social media companies also started to<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/tag/coordinated-inauthentic-behavior/\"> publicly announce</a> when they found campaigns by foreign governments that were used to mislead people online. Fran&#xE7;ois said that helped researchers and journalists better <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/30/opinion/facebook-election-security.html\">assess the techniques of foreign propagandists</a> &#x2014; and the shared knowledge helped internet companies stop trolling campaigns before they had a big impact.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Cooperation improved between government and tech companies, too. There were <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/12/technology/google-facebook-coalition-us-election.html\">regular meetings</a> between major internet companies and the federal officials responsible for election protection to share information. And internet companies began to tell the public when the U.S. government tipped them off about foreign interference on their websites.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Both Fran&#xE7;ois and Masterson said that an &#x201C;aha&#x201D; moment was the response to Iran&#x2019;s effort to intimidate voters during the fall. National security officials <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/22/us/elections/iran-and-russia-are-using-voter-data-to-try-to-influence-the-election-officials-say.html\">said</a> then that Iran had obtained some Americans&#x2019; voter-registration data, most of which was publicly available, to send <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/10/20/us/politics/florida-alaska-trump-emails.html\">deceptive messages</a> that threatened voters.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Because they were ready for threats like this, officials were able to make connections between voter intimidation in multiple states, identify the source of the menacing messages, inform election officials across the country and tell voters what was happening &#x2014; all in about a day.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;That couldn&#x2019;t have happened in 2016, and it likely couldn&#x2019;t have happened in 2018,&#x201D; Masterson said. &#x201C;That was what we had all trained for.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">What&#x2019;s next</strong></p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">While internet companies and the U.S. government caught up to the kinds of interference they faced in 2016, they <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/03/29/technology/facebook-google-twitter-november-election.html\">failed at confronting the even trickier</a> challenge of a campaign led by the president himself to cast doubt on the election process despite <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/10/us/politics/voting-fraud.html\">no substantial evidence</a>. And <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/07/us/politics/microsoft-solarwinds-hack-russia-china.html\">foreign cyber attacks</a> and <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/russian-disinformation-campaign-aims-to-undermine-confidence-in-pfizer-other-covid-19-vaccines-u-s-officials-say-11615129200\">online propaganda</a> efforts certainly haven&#x2019;t stopped.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But it could have been much worse. A lot went right in the election because powerful institutions took the risk of foreign hacking and trolling seriously and rose to the challenge. That&#x2019;s a hopeful lesson for future elections, the pandemic and other crises.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><ul class=\"css-1le37cb ez3869y0\"><li class=\"css-o74qhc eoqvrfo0\"><p class=\"css-bwdy7f evys1bk0\"><strong class=\"css-8qgvsz ebyp5n10\">It&#x2019;s a weird time to become rich: </strong>My colleague Erin Griffith writes that a booming market in tech stocks and I.P.O.s has created a conundrum for newly wealthy technologists.

        "title": "The US is about to reach a surprise milestone: too many vaccines, not enough takers",
        "content_html": "<p>The US has administered more than 118 million doses of covid-19 vaccines so far, and millions more are being injected every day. So far, demand from people who are desperate to get vaccinated has outstripped supply of the drugs, and when vaccine appointments are released, they’re quickly scooped up. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>But jurisdictions across the country may soon face the opposite problem. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>As production ramps up, the US will soon have many more doses—and not enough people who want them. The change will be rapid: Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimated that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRO_XY_HtEU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">supply and demand could shift “in the weeks to month ahead.”</a> Walmart, a major distributor of vaccines across the country, has said that the <a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/03/11/walmart-exec-says-supply-demand-dynamic-of-vaccine-rollout-could-soon-shift/\">flip could happen within a month to 45 days</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>In some states, the shift from scarcity to abundance is already here. In Idaho, where 20% of people have gotten at least one shot, many appointments have <a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/coronavirus/article249791783.html\">gone unfilled</a>, causing state officials to increase eligibility ahead of schedule. The state plans to open up appointments to those 55 and up beginning March 22. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>In a March 16 <a href=\"https://localnews8.com/health/coronavirus/2021/03/16/idaho-covid-19-vaccine-briefing-tuesday-4/\">media briefing</a>, Idaho officials said they’re making appointments available to 200,000 or more people every other week. They remain hopeful that many Idahoans who’ve been hesitant about getting vaccinated will start getting in line now that the rollout is further along. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Meanwhile, some Native American communities are running weeks ahead of any US state when it comes to delivering vaccines. The Chickasaw Nation, for example, has successfully vaccinated so many of its 38,000 residents that it is now offering shots to anyone 16 and older—and even to the <a href=\"https://www.chickasaw.net/News/Announcements/The-Chickasaw-Nation-Now-Offering-COVID-19-Vaccines-to-all-Oklahomans.aspx\">general public in Oklahoma</a>.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>This all means that America is racing toward  the point at which so many people are resistant to the virus that it becomes much harder to spread.</p></blockquote></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>This all means that America is racing toward the point at which so many people are resistant to the virus that it becomes much harder to spread. President Biden has set a goal that all states should be able to make every adult eligible for vaccination by May 1. (As for whatever may be left over, the administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-mexico-immigration-coronavirus-va%255B%25E2%2580%25A6%255D021/03/18/a63a3426-8791-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html\">plans to send</a> millions of excess doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Canada and Mexico to fill their supply gaps.) Medical experts think we will need a vaccination rate of around 80% to reach the point where infections are dramatically reduced in the US, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\">projections show</a> that 70% of Americans will be vaccinated by late June.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But those projections assume that everyone who is eligible will take a vaccine. A recent Pew study estimates, however, that only 69% of Americans want a shot. That means reaching the threshold will require efforts to understand why the “maybes” are hesitant and how their minds might be changed.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Understanding the hesitant</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Data collected by the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University could offer a road map for the coming months. In a survey of more than 1.9 million Americans, researchers found that although a rising share of people have gotten vaccinated or are willing to, <a href=\"https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2021/01/28/using-the-covid-19-symptom-survey-to-track-vaccination-uptake-and-sentiment-in-the-united-states/\">around a quarter of unvaccinated adults are still hesitant</a>. Alex Reinhart, assistant teaching professor of statistics and data science at Carnegie Mellon, hopes that research on who’s hesitant—and why—could help officials focus their efforts.  </p>\n\n\n\n<p>For example, the Delphi team found that trust in vaccines varied geographically. In southern states like Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, along with North Dakota and Wyoming, respondents were more likely to say they probably or definitely wouldn’t accept a vaccine if it were offered.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>The reasons also showed patterns. Side effects were a greater worry in Florida and Georgia than other states with a lot of <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/01/16/1016264/covid-vaccine-acceptance-us-county/\">vaccine hesitancy</a>, which suggests that state-specific outreach campaigns could help build trust. Gender was another major factor, with women significantly more concerned about side effects than men. All these insights can be used as cities, states, and community groups think about how to persuade slower adopters.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p>This pivot to messaging campaigns represents a major shift from the current mission, which has been focused on distributing limited amounts of vaccine as quickly as possible. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reinhart says that “months from now, when the most accepting people have already been vaccinated, it’s going to be more and more important to get a message out.”</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Planning for a pivot</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Some groups are already planning creative tactics to reach those not yet vaccinated. The advocacy group 1Day Sooner is lobbying Boston to hold a “<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-16/-vaccine-day-could-promise-a-pandemic-finish-line?\">Vaccine Day</a>” celebrating essential workers with music, parties, and other events for those who have been vaccinated, in the hope it will entice the public to get shots beforehand. In <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/news/dispatch/the-rural-alaskan-towns-leading-the-country-in-vaccine-distribution\">some Alaskan towns</a>, meanwhile, people receiving vaccines are entered into sweepstakes with prizes including drums of oil, trips to Hawaii, or cash toward a new vehicle.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But strategies don’t need to be elaborate. The researchers at Carnegie Mellon found that people’s regular health-care providers are consistently effective at convincing them to be vaccinated. The least effective messengers? After a year filled with misinformation, it’s perhaps not surprising that politicians sway “nearly nobody” into getting a shot. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Reinhart says we should be optimistic about the findings. “We do have work to do,” he says, “but at least things are moving in the right direction.”</p>\n\n\n\n<p><em>This story is part of the<a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/topic/covid-pandemic-tech\"> Pandemic Technology Project</a>, supported by The Rockefeller Foundation.</em></p>",

        "content_mercury": "<div class=\"gutenbergContent__content--1FgGp html_0\"> <p>The US has administered more than 118 million doses of covid-19 vaccines so far, and millions more are being injected every day. So far, demand from people who are desperate to get vaccinated has outstripped supply of the drugs, and when vaccine appointments are released, they&#x2019;re quickly scooped up.&#xA0;</p> <p>But jurisdictions across the country may soon face the opposite problem.&#xA0;</p> <p>As production ramps up, the US will soon have many more doses&#x2014;and not enough people who want them. The change will be rapid: Rochelle Walensky, director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, estimated that <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rRO_XY_HtEU&amp;feature=youtu.be\">supply and demand could shift &#x201C;in the weeks to month ahead.&#x201D;</a> Walmart, a major distributor of vaccines across the country, has said that the <a href=\"https://www.click2houston.com/news/local/2021/03/11/walmart-exec-says-supply-demand-dynamic-of-vaccine-rollout-could-soon-shift/\">flip could happen within a month to 45 days</a>.</p> <p>In some states, the shift from scarcity to abundance is already here. In Idaho, where 20% of people have gotten at least one shot, many appointments have <a href=\"https://www.idahostatesman.com/news/coronavirus/article249791783.html\">gone unfilled</a>, causing state officials to increase eligibility ahead of schedule. The state plans to open up appointments to those 55 and up beginning March 22.&#xA0;</p> <p>In a March 16 <a href=\"https://localnews8.com/health/coronavirus/2021/03/16/idaho-covid-19-vaccine-briefing-tuesday-4/\">media briefing</a>, Idaho officials said they&#x2019;re making appointments available to 200,000 or more people every other week. They remain hopeful that many Idahoans who&#x2019;ve been hesitant about getting vaccinated will start getting in line now that the rollout is further along.&#xA0;</p> <p>Meanwhile, some Native American communities are running weeks ahead of any US state when it comes to delivering vaccines. The Chickasaw Nation, for example, has successfully vaccinated so many of its 38,000 residents that it is now offering shots to anyone 16 and older&#x2014;and even to the <a href=\"https://www.chickasaw.net/News/Announcements/The-Chickasaw-Nation-Now-Offering-COVID-19-Vaccines-to-all-Oklahomans.aspx\">general public in Oklahoma</a>.</p> <figure class=\"wp-block-pullquote alignright is-style-default\"><blockquote><p>This all means that America is racing toward the point at which so many people are resistant to the virus that it becomes much harder to spread.</p></blockquote></figure> <p>This all means that America is racing toward the point at which so many people are resistant to the virus that it becomes much harder to spread. President Biden has set a goal that all states should be able to make every adult eligible for vaccination by May 1. (As for whatever may be left over, the administration <a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/biden-mexico-immigration-coronavirus-va%255B%25E2%2580%25A6%255D021/03/18/a63a3426-8791-11eb-8a67-f314e5fcf88d_story.html\">plans to send</a> millions of excess doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine to Canada and Mexico to fill their supply gaps.) Medical experts think we will need a vaccination rate of around 80% to reach the point where infections are dramatically reduced in the US, and <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2020/us/covid-19-vaccine-doses.html\">projections show</a> that 70% of Americans will be vaccinated by late June.</p> <p>But those projections assume that everyone who is eligible will take a vaccine. A recent Pew study estimates, however, that only 69% of Americans want a shot. That means reaching the threshold will require efforts to understand why the &#x201C;maybes&#x201D; are hesitant and how their minds might be changed.</p> <h3><strong>Understanding the hesitant</strong></h3> <p>Data collected by the Delphi Group at Carnegie Mellon University could offer a road map for the coming months. In a survey of more than 1.9 million Americans, researchers found that although a rising share of people have gotten vaccinated or are willing to, <a href=\"https://delphi.cmu.edu/blog/2021/01/28/using-the-covid-19-symptom-survey-to-track-vaccination-uptake-and-sentiment-in-the-united-states/\">around a quarter of unvaccinated adults are still hesitant</a>. Alex Reinhart, assistant teaching professor of statistics and data science at Carnegie Mellon, hopes that research on who&#x2019;s hesitant&#x2014;and why&#x2014;could help officials focus their efforts. &#xA0;</p> <p>For example, the Delphi team found that trust in vaccines varied geographically. In southern states like Alabama, Mississippi, Georgia, and Louisiana, along with North Dakota and Wyoming, respondents were more likely to say they probably or definitely wouldn&#x2019;t accept a vaccine if it were offered.</p> </div>",

He made a name for himself on Vine, the short-form video app that created a generation of online stars. Then he moved on to YouTube, where he and a group of friends known as the Vlog Squad began sharing fast-paced comedic content, often involving stunts.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Since 2014, he&#x2019;s amassed more than 18 million subscribers on his primary YouTube channel.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">But <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3\">an investigation by Kat Tenbarge at Insider</a> published this week, detailing sexual assault allegations against a former Vlog Squad member, led many viewers to angrily re-evaluate Mr. Dobrik&#x2019;s work and their fandom. Now it&#x2019;s challenging the success of his growing empire.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Dobrik was dubbed &#x201C;<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/david-dobrik-interview-youtube-liza-fallon-vlog-11584028115\">Gen Z&#x2019;s Jimmy Fallon</a>&#x201D; by The Wall Street Journal. Last April, he <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.newsweek.com/youtube-star-david-dobrik-explains-why-hes-not-uploading-videos-1507196\">stepped back</a> from regular vlogging, which had become challenging during the pandemic, and turned his focus to other projects, including <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/02/25/style/dispo-david-dobrik-disposable-camera-app.html\">launching his own photo sharing app, called Dispo</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">That app&#x2019;s rating dropped below two stars in Apple&#x2019;s app store last week. Apple briefly paused the ability to leave reviews, as people crowded to the space to berate Mr. Dobrik in the form of ratings and reviews.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Late on Sunday, Mr. Dobrik announced that he would leave the company and step down from the board of Dispo in order &#x201C;to not distract from the company&#x2019;s growth,&#x201D; according to a statement provided to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.theinformation.com/briefings/29a2fc\">The Information</a>. &#x201C;Dispo&#x2019;s team, product and, most importantly &#x2014; our community &#x2014; stand for building a diverse, inclusive and empowering world,&#x201D; the company said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Hours before, the venture capital firm Spark Capital, which led the start-up&#x2019;s $20 million Series A financing round in February, announced it would &#x201C;sever all ties&#x201D; with Dispo. &#x201C;We have stepped down from our position on the board, and we are in the process of making arrangements to ensure we do not profit from our recent investment in Dispo,&#x201D; the company <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/sparkcapital/status/1373855197831720963\">posted on Twitter</a>.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">On Friday, a spokesperson for HelloFresh, one of Mr. Dobrik&#x2019;s sponsors, said: &#x201C;We can confirm that we are no longer working with David Dobrik or any member of the Vlog Squad and do not have any plans to work with them again in the future.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;We&#x2019;ve made the decision to end our relationship and cancel all planned activity,&#x201D; said a representative for Dollar Shave Club. A spokesperson for EA Sports, which once gave Mr. Dobrik a Lamborghini, said the company &#x201C;can confirm we are not currently working with him nor do we have any plans to in future.&#x201D;</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">On Thursday, SeatGeek, the ticketing company that is one of Mr. Dobrik&#x2019;s largest advertisers, told Insider it was &#x201C;<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/david-dobrik-seatgeek-sponsor-tesla-rape-allegations-2021-3\">reviewing</a>&#x201D; the company&#x2019;s partnership.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In 2018, Mr. Dobrik posted a video on his YouTube channel called &#x201C;SHE SHOULD NOT HAVE PLAYED WITH FIRE!!&#x201D; It showed footage of young women socializing with Mr. Dobrik and members of the Vlog Squad as the men joked about having sexual encounters with them. Later, one of the men, Dom Zeglaitis, recounts having sex with one of them.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">That woman <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/vlog-squad-durte-dom-rape-allegation-david-dobrik-zeglaitis-video-2021-3\">told Insider that she was incapacitated</a> by alcohol during the course of the evening and described the experience as rape. Her account was corroborated by at least one other woman who was present.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The woman confirmed her story to The New York Times and provided pictures, texts and video from the evening to corroborate her account.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;We&#x2019;re going to jail,&#x201D; <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://twitter.com/defnoodles/status/1372024094867091461\">Mr. Dobrik said</a> at the end of the video.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The woman reached out to Mr. Zeglaitis to ask that the video be removed; it was, after receiving more than five million views.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The accuser has not contacted the police, and no charges have been filed.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Dobrik declined through a representative to comment. He released a <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=260IAJdFvl0\">video</a> addressing the story on Tuesday.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;I wanted to come on here real quick and address some conversations that are going on on the internet,&#x201D; Mr. Dobrik said in the video, titled &#x201C;<a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=260IAJdFvl0\">Let&#x2019;s talk</a>.&#x201D; It was posted to a secondary channel that has about a tenth of the followers of his main channel.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Dobrik said in the video that &#x201C;consent is something that&#x2019;s super, super important to me.&#x201D; He added that he seeks approval from everyone who appears in his videos and will take videos down if those featured in them no longer want to be included.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;There&#x2019;s also been moments where I&#x2019;ve looked back on videos, and I realize that these don&#x2019;t represent me anymore, and they&#x2019;re hurtful to other people, and I don&#x2019;t want them up because I&#x2019;ve grown as a content creator and as a person,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;And I don&#x2019;t agree with some of the videos I&#x2019;ve posted.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;I&#x2019;m sorry if I&#x2019;ve let you down,&#x201D; he said.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Last month, a former Vlog Squad member named Joseth &#x201C;Seth&#x201D; Francois said he was sexually assaulted in one of Mr. Dobrik&#x2019;s videos. In it, he was tricked into kissing Jason Nash, another YouTuber; Mr. Francois believed he was kissing a woman.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;The point of the video is to sexually assault me. That&#x2019;s the whole premise,&#x201D; Mr. Francois told <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/tanyachen/seth-david-dobrik-prank-sexual-assault\">BuzzFeed</a>.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Dobrik addressed that incident in his apology. &#x201C;With the Seth situation, I&#x2019;m sorry to Seth, because like I said, I just want to make videos where everybody in it, whether you&#x2019;re participating or watching, is enjoying and having a good time,&#x201D; Mr. Dobrik said. &#x201C;And I missed the mark with that one. And I&#x2019;m really sorry. I truly, truly am.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Other sponsors pulled their backing of Mr. Dobrik over the weekend. DoorDash terminated its sponsorship of Mr. Dobrik&#x2019;s podcast. &#x201C;DoorDash profoundly condemns the behavior of the Vlog Squad members, and we have terminated our sponsorship of David Dobrik&#x2019;s podcast &#x2018;Views&#x2019;. This horrific misconduct is incongruous with DoorDash&#x2019;s values and does not represent the communities we strive to create. Our thoughts are with all those impacted,&#x201D; a spokesperson told <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/brands-no-longer-working-with-youtube-star-david-dobrik-list-2021-3\">Business Insider</a>,</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">General Mills and HBO Max said they had no current campaigns with Mr. Dobrik or the Vlog Squad and no plans to work with them in the immediate future.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Mr. Dobrik has lost more than 100,000 subscribers on his primary YouTube channel in the past week.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">His career as an entertainer has made him wealthy enough to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://nypost.com/2021/02/10/david-dobriks-9-5m-house-has-hawaiian-punch-fountain/\">purchase</a> a $9.5 million house <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.realtor.com/realestateandhomes-detail/3703-Alomar-Dr_Sherman-Oaks_CA_91423_M14319-95157\">in Los Angeles</a> &#x2014; complete with a Hawaiian Punch fountain.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In Mr. Dobrik&#x2019;s apology video, he also said that he &#x201C;chose to distance&#x201D; himself from some people previously featured in his content. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t stand for any kind of misconduct,&#x201D; he said, &#x201C;and I&#x2019;ve been really disappointed in some of my friends, and for that reason I&#x2019;ve separated from a lot of them.&#x201D;</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div></section></div>",

The findings are broadly in line with the 95% and 94% efficacy that Pfizer and Moderna vaccines showed, respectively, in their clinical trials.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>The details:</strong> The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/mmwr/volumes/70/wr/mm7013e3.htm?s_cid=mm7013e3_w\">study</a> recruited essential workers, including healthcare workers, and followed them over a 13-week period from December 2020 to March 2021, requiring them to take weekly tests. Almost 75% of the group received at least one dose of one of the mRNA vaccines. Among the cohort that received both doses, vaccine effectiveness was 90%. For the group that had received just one dose, effectiveness was 80% after two weeks. There were 161 covid-19 infections among the unvaccinated group, compared with 16 who had received one dose, and just three in people who had received both doses. There were no covid-19 deaths in the study.</p>\n\n\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Solid findings: </strong>This new study provides yet more promising data on the positive effect vaccines are starting to have on the pandemic.  Last month, England’s health authority <a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/phe-monitoring-of-the-effectiveness-of-covid-19-vaccination\">reported </a>that a single shot of either the Oxford/AstraZeneca or the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine cut the chance of needing hospital treatment by more than 80%. Israel, which has vaccinated more than half its population, recently <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/19/1019264/a-leaked-report-pfizers-vaccine-conquering-covid-19-in-its-largest-real-world-test/\">reported</a> that the Pfizer/BioNTech vaccine had 94% efficacy against infection and 92% against severe disease.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>A worrying catch: </strong>Cases are on the rise again in several US states, despite the rapidly accelerating vaccine program (72% of Americans 65 and older have now been vaccinated). In a briefing yesterday, CDC director Rochelle Walensky <a href=\"https://www.axios.com/cdc-fourth-wave-db0a4d6e-3942-4719-9743-62912e5557e0.html\">made a plea</a> to Americans to keep following public health measures, saying she had a “recurring feeling” of “impending doom.” She said: “We have so much to look forward to, so much promise and potential of where we are and so much reason for hope. But right now, I’m scared.” The increase in US cases is most likely thanks to the effect of the more transmissible UK variant. The growing spread of <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/covid-19-variant-rages-in-brazil-posing-global-risk-11616845889\">variants</a> makes the need for as many as people as possible to get vaccinated even more urgent—not only in the US, but in countries <a href=\"https://www.technologyreview.com/2021/02/13/1018259/why-a-failure-to-vaccinate-the-world-will-put-us-all-at-risk/\">around the world</a> as supplies have already been bought up.

Once the store closes, Flores will be moved to a remote customer service position where she will make less money.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very devastating. I&#x2019;m basically the head of my household. I&#x2019;m having to budget a little more. I&#x2019;ve been having a lot of anxiety about how I am going to come up with extra funds for my kids,&#x201D; Flores said. </p><figure id=\"b6916c2d-0f4f-44d9-b150-9f9d32be53fb\" class=\"css-1mfia18\"></figure><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Flores said her commission was anywhere between $800 to $1,500 a month, which she will no longer receive working remotely. Though AT&amp;T has informed her they plan to provide some sort of additional compensation for the first year, she is concerned about what happens after that. Flores and her family have already been struggling financially due to the pandemic, and for the local communities who relied on the store as it was the only nearby location with Spanish speakers available.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;They told us it&#x2019;s closing because of performance, but we were in the top 15% in sales for AT&amp;T in the nation,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;We never thought we were going to get closed down. It was heartbreaking because we don&#x2019;t only cater to our local community, but the neighboring communities as well.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">When AT&amp;T first began rolling out the store closures during the pandemic, they cited the cuts as part of a <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/06/16/atts-6-billion-cost-cutting-plan-includes-retail-store-closings/\">$6bn cost-cutting plan</a> that the pandemic gave AT&amp;T a &#x201C;head-start&#x201D; in implementing it. The CWA has <a href=\"https://www.fiercewireless.com/operators/at-t-closing-320-more-company-owned-stores-report#:~:text=AT%26T%20is%20closing%20320%20company,closed%20earlier%20in%20the%20year.\">noted </a>retail cuts and an emphasis on an authorized retailer model were part of plans proposed by the hedge fund Elliot Management before the pandemic.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://finance.yahoo.com/news/atandt-ceo-says-theyll-invest-least-1-billion-create-7000-jobs-tax-reform-passes-200245187.html\">lobbied aggressively</a> in favor of the 2017 Trump tax cuts, promising to create 7,000 new jobs and invest $1bn in capital expenditures if it passed. AT&amp;T saved an <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/business/2019/jun/15/job-losses-trump-tax-cut-at-t-general-motors-wells-fargo\">estimated</a> $21bn when the tax cuts passed and the company saved an estimated $3bn annually due to the lower corporate tax rate from <a href=\"https://www.thebalance.com/trump-s-tax-plan-how-it-affects-you-4113968\">35% to 21%</a>.</p><aside class=\"css-1kl3axy\"><span class=\"css-h3y4hc\"><svg width=\"70\" height=\"49\" class=\"css-u6yq9m\"><path/></svg></span><blockquote class=\"css-6n7j50\">It&#x2019;s an attack on this group of workers, the communities that they&#x2019;re in and on our union</blockquote><footer><cite class=\"css-1irn6li\">Kieran Knutson</cite></footer></aside><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Since the tax cuts, AT&amp;T <a href=\"https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/instead-of-cutting-jobs-att-must-lead-recovery\">eliminated more than 42,000 jobs</a> even before the first retail store closures in June 2020 went into effect.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Larry Thompson, a retail sales consultant for AT&amp;T in St Paul, Minnesota, who serves as the chief steward and area vice-president for retail at CWA Local 7250, explained these store closures are part of a trend nationwide where AT&amp;T is closing down corporate-owned stores and transitioning to a model that utilizes non-union, authorized retailers.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The union is working to spread public awareness, get elected officials involved and assert to AT&amp;T leadership that workers and the union will fight to prevent the ongoing job cuts and store closures.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;This company promises a lot of things. They received a lot of tax cuts with the expectation that we would have long-term jobs and a long-term solution,&#x201D; said Thompson. &#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t going to go away. We&#x2019;re going to go down fighting.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">A spokesperson for AT&amp;T said the upcoming store closures were among those announced late last year. They cited changing consumer habits as the reason for the closures, and that AT&amp;T has provided existing authorized retail partners opportunities to buy the closing stores.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;We are transforming our business. That includes announcing last fall that we were adjusting our retail presence to reflect our customers&#x2019; shopping practices, which changed more quickly because of the pandemic,&#x201D; said the spokesperson in an email. &#x201C;Represented employees at affected stores were offered other union positions within the company. We are proud to be one of the largest union-represented companies and the only unionized wireless company.&#x201D;</p></div>",

The cable carrying them holds 36 such orbs, spaced 50 feet apart. There are 64 such cables, held in place by anchors and buoys, two miles off the jagged southern coast of this lake in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/world/europe/russia-lake-baikal-tourism.html\">Siberia with a bottom that is more than a mile down</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">This is a telescope, the largest of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere, built to explore black holes, distant galaxies and the remnants of exploded stars. It does so by searching for neutrinos, cosmic particles so tiny that many trillions pass through each of us every second. If only we could learn to read the messages they bear, scientists believe, we could chart the universe, and its history, in ways we cannot yet fully fathom.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;You should never miss the chance to ask nature any question,&#x201D; said Grigori V.

And this hunt for neutrinos from the far reaches of the cosmos, spanning eras in geopolitics and in astrophysics, sheds light on how Russia has managed to preserve some of the scientific prowess that characterized the Soviet Union &#x2014; as well as the limitations of that legacy.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Lake Baikal venture is not the only effort to hunt for neutrinos in the world&#x2019;s most remote places.

It was the first time that scientists had pinpointed a source of the rain of high-energy particles from space known as cosmic rays &#x2014; a breakthrough for neutrino astronomy, a branch that remains in its infancy.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The field&#x2019;s practitioners believe that as they learn to read the universe using neutrinos, they could make new, unexpected discoveries &#x2014; <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://icecube.berkeley.edu/amanda/ice-fishing.html\">much as the lensmakers</a> who first developed the telescope could not have imagined that Galileo would later use it to discover the <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2016/07/01/science/space/jupiter-and-its-moons.html\">moons of Jupiter</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s like looking at the sky at night, and seeing one star,&#x201D; Francis L. Halzen, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the director of IceCube, said in a telephone interview, describing the current state of the hunt for the ghostly particles.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Early work by Soviet scientists helped inspire Dr. Halzen in the 1980s to build a neutrino detector in the Antarctic ice. Now, Dr. Halzen says his team believes it may have found two additional sources of neutrinos arriving from deep in space &#x2014; but it is difficult to be certain, because no one else has detected them. He hopes that will change in the coming years as the Baikal telescope expands.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;We have to be superconservative because nobody, at the moment, can check what we are doing,&#x201D; Dr. Halzen said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s exciting for me to have another experiment to interact with and to exchange data with.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In the 1970s, despite the Cold War, the Americans and the Soviets were working together to plan a first deep water neutrino detector off the coast of Hawaii. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the Soviets were kicked out of the project. So, in 1980, the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow started its own neutrino-telescope effort, led by Dr. Domogatski. The place to try seemed obvious, although it was about 2,500 miles away: Baikal.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The project did not get far beyond planning and design before the Soviet Union collapsed, throwing many of the country&#x2019;s scientists into poverty and their efforts into disarray. But an institute outside Berlin, which soon became part of Germany&#x2019;s DESY particle research center, joined the Baikal effort.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Christian Spiering, who led the German team, recalls shipping hundreds of pounds of butter, sugar, coffee and sausage to sustain the annual winter expeditions onto the Baikal ice. He also brought to Moscow thousands of dollars&#x2019; worth of cash to supplement the Russians&#x2019; meager salaries.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Dr. Domogatski and his team persisted. When a Lithuanian electronics maker refused to accept rubles as payment, one of the physicists negotiated to pay with a train car full of cedar wood, Dr. Spiering recalls.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In a conversation with Dr. Spiering, Dr. Domogatski once compared his scientists to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/frogs-in-milk#:~:text=One%20proverb%20tells%20of%20two,gives%20into%20despair%20and%20drowns.&amp;text=By%20the%20morning%2C%20the%20milk,butter%20and%20the%20frog%20escapes\">the frog in a Russian proverb</a> that fell in a vat of milk and had only one way to survive: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s got to keep moving, until the milk turns to butter.&#x201D;</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">The rising sun over Lake Baikal.

It would need a bigger detector for that. As Russia started to reinvest in science in the 2000s under President Vladimir V. Putin, Dr. Domogatski managed to secure more than $30 million in funding to build a new Baikal telescope as big as IceCube.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The lake is as much as a mile deep, with some of the clearest fresh water in the world, and a czarist-era railroad conveniently skirts the southern shore. Most important, it is covered by a three-foot-thick sheet of ice in the winter: nature&#x2019;s ideal platform for installing an underwater photomultiplier array.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s as if Baikal is made for this type of research,&#x201D; said Bair Shaybonov, a researcher on the project.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Construction began in 2015, and a first phase encompassing 2,304 light-detecting orbs suspended in the depths is scheduled to be completed by the time the ice melts in April. (The orbs remain suspended in the water year-round, watching for neutrinos and sending data to the scientists&#x2019; lakeshore base by underwater cable.) The telescope has been collecting data for years, but Russia&#x2019;s minister of science, Valery N. Falkov, plunged a chain saw into the ice as part of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.jinr.ru/posts/baikal-gvd-launched/\">a made-for-television opening ceremony this month</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Baikal telescope looks down, through the entire planet, out the other side, toward the center of our galaxy and beyond, essentially using Earth as a giant sieve. For the most part, larger particles hitting the opposite side of the planet eventually collide with atoms. But almost all neutrinos &#x2014; 100 billion of which pass through your fingertip every second &#x2014; continue, essentially, on a straight line.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Yet when a neutrino, exceedingly rarely, hits an atomic nucleus in the water, it produces a cone of blue light called Cherenkov radiation. The effect was discovered by the Soviet physicist Pavel A. Cherenkov, one of Dr. Domogatski&#x2019;s former colleagues down the hall at his institute in Moscow.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">If you spend years monitoring a billion tons of deep water for unimaginably tiny flashes of Cherenkov light, many physicists believe, you will eventually find neutrinos that can be traced back to cosmic conflagrations that emitted them billions of light-years away.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The orientation of the blue cones even reveals the precise direction from which the neutrinos that caused them came. By not having an electrical charge, neutrinos are not affected by interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields and other influences that scramble the paths of other types of cosmic particles, such as protons and electrons. Neutrinos go as straight through the universe as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/24/science/what-is-einsteins-general-relativity.html\">Einsteinian gravity will allow</a>.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">That is what makes neutrinos so valuable to the study of the universe&#x2019;s earliest, most distant and most violent events. And they could help elucidate other mysteries, such as what happens when stars far more massive than the sun collapse into a superdense ball of neutrons roughly 12 miles across &#x2014; emitting huge quantities of neutrinos.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">An old railway building at the lake&#x2019;s southern end was converted to a dining facility for scientists working at the observatory.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">Patterns in the ice on the lake&#x2019;s surface.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">Despite the project&#x2019;s significance, it operates on a modest budget, with almost all of the roughly 60 scientists spending February and March at their camp in Baikal, installing and repairing its components.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;It travels the universe, colliding with practically nothing and no one,&#x201D; Dr. Domogatski said of the neutrino. &#x201C;For it, the universe is a transparent world.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Because it essentially looks through the planet, the Baikal telescope studies the sky of the Southern Hemisphere. That makes it a complement to IceCube in Antarctica, along with a European project in the Mediterranean that is at an earlier phase of construction.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;We need an equivalent to IceCube in the Northern Hemisphere,&#x201D; said Dr. Spiering, who remains involved in both the IceCube and Baikal projects.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Dr. Domogatski says that his team is already exchanging data with neutrino hunters elsewhere, and that it has found evidence backing up IceCube&#x2019;s conclusions about neutrinos arriving from outer space. Still, he acknowledges that the Baikal project is lagging far behind others in developing the computer software necessary to identify neutrinos in close to real time.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Despite the project&#x2019;s significance, it is still operating on a shoestring budget &#x2014; almost all of the roughly 60 scientists working on the telescope usually spend February and March at their camp in Baikal, installing and repairing its components. IceCube, by contrast, involves some 300 scientists, most of whom have never been to the South Pole.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">These days, Dr. Domogatski no longer joins the annual winter expeditions to Baikal. But he still works out of the same Soviet-era institute where he kept his neutrino dream afloat through Communism, the chaotic 1990s and more than two decades of Mr. Putin&apos;s rule.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;If you take on a project, you must understand that you have to realize it in any conditions that come up,&#x201D; Dr. Domogatski said, banging on his desk for emphasis. &#x201C;Otherwise, there&#x2019;s no point in even starting.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-pncxxs etfikam0\">Oleg Matsnev contributed research.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div></section></div>",

Even though we don&#x2019;t know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country, and we have exposed the lengths to which employers will go to crush their employees trying to gain a union voice,&#x201D; said Stuart Appelbaum, president of RWDSU. &#x201C;This campaign has become the prime example for why we need labor law reform in this country.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Around 5,800 employees were eligible to vote in the election, with a majority of those who voted to determine the outcome.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The results could take a while to be finally counted and the process could be legally fraught. The NLRB said it will not have an estimate for how long the vote count will take until counting begins. The union estimated it will take about a week for results.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">During the vote count, the union and Amazon will have the opportunity to challenge the veracity of ballots and <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/fact-sheets/nlrb-representation-case-procedures-fact-sheet/main-steps-representation\">file</a> objections within five business days of the vote count. </p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The results could also be delayed if enough ballots are challenged to affect the outcome of the election, at which point a hearing officer with the NLRB will determine whether a challenged ballot will be counted. </p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Amazon aggressively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/03/amazon-intensifies-severe-effort-discourage-first-warehouse-union\">opposed</a> the union organizing efforts at the Bessemer warehouse, encouraging workers to vote &#x201C;no&#x201D; in the election through posters, signs, mailings, a <a href=\"https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/\">website</a>, texts, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-anti-union-ads-removed-by-twitch-alabama-warehouse-2021-2\">ads</a>, captive audience meetings, and hired union avoidance consultants at nearly $10,000 per day ahead of the election. Under the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/pro-act-problem-solution-chart/\">Pro Act</a>, a labor law reform bill supported by Democrats and labor unions around the US, employers would be prohibited from forcing workers into captive audience meetings, and fines would significantly be increased for labor law violations.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The union drive has received <a href=\"https://southernworker.org/amazon/\">support</a> from unions and organizations in the Bessemer area and around the US. Several congress members <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/lawmakers-show-solidarity-for-amazon-union-vote-in-alabama.html\">visited</a> the union organizing site over the past few weeks to show their support for the workers.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;This election is important because it&#x2019;s the start to addressing inadequate working conditions,&#x201D; said Eric Hall, founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Birmingham, Alabama, which has supported the union organizing efforts and participated in rallies to garner community support for the workers.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">An <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/technology/amazon-union-vote.html\">estimated 85%</a> of the Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer are Black.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;Birmingham is a city known for its strong stance for civil rights. Its people led a rebellion against racism and Jim Crow, and in this present day movement it&#x2019;s the grand and great grandchildren fighting against today&#x2019;s injustices, fighting against the rich and powerful, fighting systemic racism, fighting economic and social injustice,&#x201D; said Hall.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">According to the RWDSU, hundreds of Amazon workers around the US have<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/amazon-workers-inspired-by-alabama-weigh-union-drives-elsewhere\"> reached out</a> to the union during the Alabama organizing effort with interests to start union organizing within their workplaces.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">As the union election in Alabama concluded, Amazon executives increasingly attacked their critics, with recent spars on social media from Amazon CEO Dave Clark and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1375529101931520007\">Amazon&#x2019;s communications team</a> against<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1375045409542823939\"> Senator Bernie Sanders</a>, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressman Mark Pocan.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">According to Recode, the tweets came after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren\">expressed </a>dismay that executives weren&#x2019;t pushing back enough on criticism toward the company.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Shortly after Amazon&#x2019;s PR account claimed reports workers urinate in bottles due to their inability to take bathroom breaks during shifts are false, The Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/\">reported </a>on leaked emails and memos where Amazon management discussed problems with delivery drivers urinating in plastic bottles and defecating in plastic bags.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a> spokesperson said in an email: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees&#x2019; views. Our employees choose to work at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a> because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.&#x201D;</p></div>",

Tariq told the Guardian. &#x201C;Not because these are bad people but because they run for-profit machines that will operate exactly as you would expect them to do,&#x201D; said Fancy.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Fancy, 42, worked for BlackRock between 2018 and 2019 and was the investor&#x2019;s chief investment officer for sustainable investing at a time when BlackRock was preparing to announce a major shift in strategy.</p><figure class=\"css-1sioudk\"><div class=\"css-1nfcn93\"><picture><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=57329ce7e415af3983a394bebb2e5db5 760w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=8f59f4e5ac2483c26ee888ede483ae08 600w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=e6d313594d860f4c75d51669200a24bd 1240w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=7b7abb829113fbc614680f21396d4fd0 1210w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=1ff12aa96bf2b0e162e8d90beedab1b8 890w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px\"><source srcset=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=380&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=15069b6a62cceac590c63603ee717ba4 380w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=89216f453f417355ef9ecdee826fe70f 300w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=620&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=1c2fda6257b91d0c7d57bcb710a6f78c 620w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=605&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=0737d8beaebade5a311a4c2eadbc9d8e 605w, https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=445&amp;quality=85&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;s=4f8eacc6e279d680d62d8ad1799b1fa2 445w\" sizes=\"(min-width: 1300px) 380px, 300px\"><img alt=\"Tariq Fancy, former BlackRock executive: &#x2018;This is definitely not going to work.&#x2019;\" src=\"https://i.guim.co.uk/img/media/ecfa01e53a37cd2ee61c399b83a5f5ec106e6ed0/0_289_2304_2878/master/2304.jpg?width=300&amp;quality=45&amp;auto=format&amp;fit=max&amp;dpr=2&amp;s=8f59f4e5ac2483c26ee888ede483ae08\" width=\"2304\" class=\"css-uk6cul\"></picture></div><figcaption class=\"css-zq9xdq\"><span class=\"css-1amgqzt\"><svg width=\"11\" height=\"10\"><path/></svg></span><span class=\"css-19x4pdv\">Tariq Fancy, former BlackRock executive.</span> Photograph: Rumie</figcaption></figure><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;The evidence on climate risk is compelling investors to reassess core assumptions about modern finance,&#x201D; the BlackRock chairman, Larry Fink, wrote in his highly <a href=\"https://www.blackrock.com/corporate/investor-relations/larry-fink-ceo-letter\">influential annual letter</a> to CEOs in 2020, shortly after Fancy&#x2019;s departure. &#x201C;In the near future &#x2013; and sooner than most anticipate &#x2013; there will be a significant reallocation of capital.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">In future, Fink said, BlackRock would transition away from investments in companies that &#x201C;present a high sustainability-related risk&#x201D;.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">BlackRock manages about $7tn in assets and, with one of Wall Street&#x2019;s biggest voices sounding the alarm about the need to deal with the climate crisis, the news was viewed as a pivotal moment for the financial community.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">But for Fancy, who now runs the digital learning non-profit <a href=\"https://about.rumie.org/\">Rumie</a> in Toronto, Canada, BlackRock&#x2019;s move, and the ones it has inspired, contain a fundamental flaw: the climate crisis can never be solved by today&#x2019;s free markets.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s not because they are evil, it&#x2019;s because the system is built to extract profits,&#x201D; he said.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Investors have a fiduciary duty to maximise returns to their clients and as long as there is money to be made in activities that contribute to global warming, no amount of rhetoric about the need for sustainable investing will change that, he believes.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;In many cases it&#x2019;s cheaper and easier to market yourself as green rather than do the long tail work of actually improving your sustainability profile. That&#x2019;s expensive and if there is no penalty from the government, in the form of a carbon tax or anything else, then this market failure is going to persist,&#x201D; said Fancy, a former investment banker who now leads an initiative to bring affordable digital education to underserved communities worldwide.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The amount of money that poured into sustainable investment through vehicles like exchange traded funds (ETFs) <a href=\"https://www.refinitiv.com/perspectives/market-insights/sustainable-finance-market-continues-2020-growth/\">hit record levels</a> last year. It&#x2019;s a trend Fancy believes could continue for years and still have zero impact on climate change because &#x201C;there is no connection between the two things&#x201D;.</p><aside class=\"css-1kl3axy\"><span class=\"css-h3y4hc\"><svg width=\"70\" height=\"49\" class=\"css-u6yq9m\"><path/></svg></span><blockquote class=\"css-6n7j50\">In many cases it&#x2019;s cheaper and easier to market yourself as green</blockquote><footer><cite class=\"css-1irn6li\"></cite></footer></aside><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Moving money to green investments doesn&#x2019;t mean polluters will no longer find backers. The argument is similar to that of divestment, another strategy Fancy says doesn&#x2019;t work. &#x201C;If you sell your stock in a company that has a high emissions footprint, it doesn&#x2019;t matter. The company still exists, the only difference is that you don&#x2019;t own them. The company is going to keep on going the way they were and there are 20 hedge funds who will buy that stock overnight. The market is the market.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;I don&#x2019;t think the public realizes we are not talking about stopping climate change,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;We are literally talking about selling assets so we don&#x2019;t get caught up in the damage when it hits.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Business knows this, Fancy said, and it also knows the solution &#x2013; it just doesn&#x2019;t like it. He compared the business communities reaction to the coronavirus pandemic to its views on climate change. &#x201C;Science shows us that Covid-19 is a systemic problem for which we all need to bend down a curve, the infections curve.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">As the crisis escalated business leaders were immediately supportive of government-led initiatives to restrict travel, close venues and shutter the economy. &#x201C;The Business Roundtable [the US&#x2019;s most powerful business lobby] said we should make mask-wearing mandatory. They were right about all those things,&#x201D; he said.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The world needed government to use its extraordinary powers &#x201C;because if you left it to the free market everything would have been open in the US and we would have lost millions of people, it wouldn&#x2019;t have been half a million&#x201D;.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Climate change too is a problem science says is systemic and one where we have to bend down the curve. &#x201C;The difference is the incubation period. It&#x2019;s not a few weeks, it&#x2019;s a few decades. For that they are still saying we should rely on the free market. That&#x2019;s where I have a problem.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">A survey of 250 senior executives supports Fancy&#x2019;s point. About 64% of the executives surveyed in a <a href=\"https://www.sc.com/en/insights/zeronomics/\">recent poll</a> commissioned by British lender Standard Chartered said they &#x201C;believe the economics of operating as a net-zero [carbon emissions] organization do not stack up for their company&#x201D;. And 79% of senior executives said short-term CEO tenure made it harder for companies to transition to net zero.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\"> Under the current system the costs, says Fancy, are simply too high and the benefits of conducting business as usual are too great. A 2019 <a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/ideas/investing-in-decarbonization#:~:text=Although%20getting%20there%20won%27t,costs%20to%20decarbonize%20are%20substantial.\">Morgan Stanley study</a> found that getting to net zero by 2050 will cost $50tn.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;The reality is that their incentives are very short-term,&#x201D; he said. &#x201C;My concern is that when it comes to climate change, it&#x2019;s actually expensive. It&#x2019;s like saying when it comes for Covid-19 that&#x2019;s a crisis and an opportunity. Well yeah, it&#x2019;s an opportunity for Zoom, it&#x2019;s not an opportunity for society.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">There is a solution, said Fancy, and it&#x2019;s the one that business leaders embraced in the coronavirus crisis: government intervention. But &#x2013; given the long time line for climate change &#x2013; it&#x2019;s one that business leaders don&#x2019;t like.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">What would work is a change in government policy that made it more expensive to pollute, such as a carbon tax, because that would change the corporate world and Wall Street&#x2019;s incentives.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;If you put a tax on carbon, every single portfolio manager would adjust their portfolio,&#x201D; he said.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">BlackRock disputes Fancy&#x2019;s analysis. In a statement the company said: &#x201C;Sustainable investing can deliver strong investment returns while also helping to address urgent social and environmental concerns.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The company added that it believes greenwashing &#x201C;is a risk to investors and detrimental to the asset management industry&#x2019;s credibility, which is why we strongly support regulatory initiatives to set consistent standards and increase transparency for sustainable portfolios&#x201D;.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">But for Fancy the overarching point is that real change has to be led by government, not Wall Street.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;If I was on a panel and someone asked me what&#x2019;s the best way to tackle climate change? Should I buy an ETF or should I call my congressperson and demand legislation and a price on carbon? The truth is someone is better off calling their congressperson.&#x201D;</p></div>",

Once the store closes, Flores will be moved to a remote customer service position where she will make less money.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s very devastating. I&#x2019;m basically the head of my household. I&#x2019;m having to budget a little more. I&#x2019;ve been having a lot of anxiety about how I am going to come up with extra funds for my kids,&#x201D; Flores said. </p><figure id=\"b6916c2d-0f4f-44d9-b150-9f9d32be53fb\" class=\"css-1mfia18\"></figure><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Flores said her commission was anywhere between $800 to $1,500 a month, which she will no longer receive working remotely. Though AT&amp;T has informed her they plan to provide some sort of additional compensation for the first year, she is concerned about what happens after that. Flores and her family have already been struggling financially due to the pandemic, and for the local communities who relied on the store as it was the only nearby location with Spanish speakers available.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;They told us it&#x2019;s closing because of performance, but we were in the top 15% in sales for AT&amp;T in the nation,&#x201D; she added. &#x201C;We never thought we were going to get closed down. It was heartbreaking because we don&#x2019;t only cater to our local community, but the neighboring communities as well.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">When AT&amp;T first began rolling out the store closures during the pandemic, they cited the cuts as part of a <a href=\"https://www.dallasnews.com/business/local-companies/2020/06/16/atts-6-billion-cost-cutting-plan-includes-retail-store-closings/\">$6bn cost-cutting plan</a> that the pandemic gave AT&amp;T a &#x201C;head-start&#x201D; in implementing it.

They received a lot of tax cuts with the expectation that we would have long-term jobs and a long-term solution,&#x201D; said Thompson. &#x201C;We aren&#x2019;t going to go away. We&#x2019;re going to go down fighting.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">A spokesperson for AT&amp;T said the upcoming store closures were among those announced late last year. They cited changing consumer habits as the reason for the closures, and that AT&amp;T has provided existing authorized retail partners opportunities to buy the closing stores.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;We are transforming our business. That includes announcing last fall that we were adjusting our retail presence to reflect our customers&#x2019; shopping practices, which changed more quickly because of the pandemic,&#x201D; said the spokesperson in an email. &#x201C;Represented employees at affected stores were offered other union positions within the company. We are proud to be one of the largest union-represented companies and the only unionized wireless company.&#x201D;</p></div>",

The cable carrying them holds 36 such orbs, spaced 50 feet apart. There are 64 such cables, held in place by anchors and buoys, two miles off the jagged southern coast of this lake in <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/15/world/europe/russia-lake-baikal-tourism.html\">Siberia with a bottom that is more than a mile down</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">This is a telescope, the largest of its kind in the Northern Hemisphere, built to explore black holes, distant galaxies and the remnants of exploded stars.

And this hunt for neutrinos from the far reaches of the cosmos, spanning eras in geopolitics and in astrophysics, sheds light on how Russia has managed to preserve some of the scientific prowess that characterized the Soviet Union &#x2014; as well as the limitations of that legacy.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Lake Baikal venture is not the only effort to hunt for neutrinos in the world&#x2019;s most remote places.

Halzen, an astrophysicist at the University of Wisconsin, Madison, and the director of IceCube, said in a telephone interview, describing the current state of the hunt for the ghostly particles.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Early work by Soviet scientists helped inspire Dr. Halzen in the 1980s to build a neutrino detector in the Antarctic ice. Now, Dr. Halzen says his team believes it may have found two additional sources of neutrinos arriving from deep in space &#x2014; but it is difficult to be certain, because no one else has detected them. He hopes that will change in the coming years as the Baikal telescope expands.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;We have to be superconservative because nobody, at the moment, can check what we are doing,&#x201D; Dr. Halzen said. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s exciting for me to have another experiment to interact with and to exchange data with.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In the 1970s, despite the Cold War, the Americans and the Soviets were working together to plan a first deep water neutrino detector off the coast of Hawaii. But after the Soviet Union invaded Afghanistan, the Soviets were kicked out of the project. So, in 1980, the Institute for Nuclear Research in Moscow started its own neutrino-telescope effort, led by Dr. Domogatski. The place to try seemed obvious, although it was about 2,500 miles away: Baikal.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The project did not get far beyond planning and design before the Soviet Union collapsed, throwing many of the country&#x2019;s scientists into poverty and their efforts into disarray. But an institute outside Berlin, which soon became part of Germany&#x2019;s DESY particle research center, joined the Baikal effort.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Christian Spiering, who led the German team, recalls shipping hundreds of pounds of butter, sugar, coffee and sausage to sustain the annual winter expeditions onto the Baikal ice. He also brought to Moscow thousands of dollars&#x2019; worth of cash to supplement the Russians&#x2019; meager salaries.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Dr. Domogatski and his team persisted. When a Lithuanian electronics maker refused to accept rubles as payment, one of the physicists negotiated to pay with a train car full of cedar wood, Dr. Spiering recalls.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">In a conversation with Dr. Spiering, Dr. Domogatski once compared his scientists to <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/frogs-in-milk#:~:text=One%20proverb%20tells%20of%20two,gives%20into%20despair%20and%20drowns.&amp;text=By%20the%20morning%2C%20the%20milk,butter%20and%20the%20frog%20escapes\">the frog in a Russian proverb</a> that fell in a vat of milk and had only one way to survive: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s got to keep moving, until the milk turns to butter.&#x201D;</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">The rising sun over Lake Baikal.

It would need a bigger detector for that. As Russia started to reinvest in science in the 2000s under President Vladimir V. Putin, Dr. Domogatski managed to secure more than $30 million in funding to build a new Baikal telescope as big as IceCube.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The lake is as much as a mile deep, with some of the clearest fresh water in the world, and a czarist-era railroad conveniently skirts the southern shore. Most important, it is covered by a three-foot-thick sheet of ice in the winter: nature&#x2019;s ideal platform for installing an underwater photomultiplier array.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;It&#x2019;s as if Baikal is made for this type of research,&#x201D; said Bair Shaybonov, a researcher on the project.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Construction began in 2015, and a first phase encompassing 2,304 light-detecting orbs suspended in the depths is scheduled to be completed by the time the ice melts in April. (The orbs remain suspended in the water year-round, watching for neutrinos and sending data to the scientists&#x2019; lakeshore base by underwater cable.) The telescope has been collecting data for years, but Russia&#x2019;s minister of science, Valery N. Falkov, plunged a chain saw into the ice as part of <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"http://www.jinr.ru/posts/baikal-gvd-launched/\">a made-for-television opening ceremony this month</a>.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The Baikal telescope looks down, through the entire planet, out the other side, toward the center of our galaxy and beyond, essentially using Earth as a giant sieve. For the most part, larger particles hitting the opposite side of the planet eventually collide with atoms. But almost all neutrinos &#x2014; 100 billion of which pass through your fingertip every second &#x2014; continue, essentially, on a straight line.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Yet when a neutrino, exceedingly rarely, hits an atomic nucleus in the water, it produces a cone of blue light called Cherenkov radiation. The effect was discovered by the Soviet physicist Pavel A. Cherenkov, one of Dr. Domogatski&#x2019;s former colleagues down the hall at his institute in Moscow.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">If you spend years monitoring a billion tons of deep water for unimaginably tiny flashes of Cherenkov light, many physicists believe, you will eventually find neutrinos that can be traced back to cosmic conflagrations that emitted them billions of light-years away.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">The orientation of the blue cones even reveals the precise direction from which the neutrinos that caused them came. By not having an electrical charge, neutrinos are not affected by interstellar and intergalactic magnetic fields and other influences that scramble the paths of other types of cosmic particles, such as protons and electrons. Neutrinos go as straight through the universe as <a class=\"css-1g7m0tk\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/11/24/science/what-is-einsteins-general-relativity.html\">Einsteinian gravity will allow</a>.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">That is what makes neutrinos so valuable to the study of the universe&#x2019;s earliest, most distant and most violent events. And they could help elucidate other mysteries, such as what happens when stars far more massive than the sun collapse into a superdense ball of neutrons roughly 12 miles across &#x2014; emitting huge quantities of neutrinos.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">An old railway building at the lake&#x2019;s southern end was converted to a dining facility for scientists working at the observatory.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">Patterns in the ice on the lake&#x2019;s surface.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-79elbk\"><div class=\"css-1a48zt4 ehw59r15\"><figure class=\"css-1ef8w8q e1g7ppur0\"><figcaption class=\"css-18crmh6 ewdxa0s0\"><span class=\"css-16f3y1r e13ogyst0\">Despite the project&#x2019;s significance, it operates on a modest budget, with almost all of the roughly 60 scientists spending February and March at their camp in Baikal, installing and repairing its components.</span></figcaption></figure></div></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;It travels the universe, colliding with practically nothing and no one,&#x201D; Dr. Domogatski said of the neutrino. &#x201C;For it, the universe is a transparent world.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Because it essentially looks through the planet, the Baikal telescope studies the sky of the Southern Hemisphere. That makes it a complement to IceCube in Antarctica, along with a European project in the Mediterranean that is at an earlier phase of construction.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;We need an equivalent to IceCube in the Northern Hemisphere,&#x201D; said Dr. Spiering, who remains involved in both the IceCube and Baikal projects.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div><div class=\"css-1fanzo5 StoryBodyCompanionColumn\"><div class=\"css-53u6y8\"><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Dr. Domogatski says that his team is already exchanging data with neutrino hunters elsewhere, and that it has found evidence backing up IceCube&#x2019;s conclusions about neutrinos arriving from outer space. Still, he acknowledges that the Baikal project is lagging far behind others in developing the computer software necessary to identify neutrinos in close to real time.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">Despite the project&#x2019;s significance, it is still operating on a shoestring budget &#x2014; almost all of the roughly 60 scientists working on the telescope usually spend February and March at their camp in Baikal, installing and repairing its components. IceCube, by contrast, involves some 300 scientists, most of whom have never been to the South Pole.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">These days, Dr. Domogatski no longer joins the annual winter expeditions to Baikal. But he still works out of the same Soviet-era institute where he kept his neutrino dream afloat through Communism, the chaotic 1990s and more than two decades of Mr. Putin&apos;s rule.</p><p class=\"css-axufdj evys1bk0\">&#x201C;If you take on a project, you must understand that you have to realize it in any conditions that come up,&#x201D; Dr. Domogatski said, banging on his desk for emphasis. &#x201C;Otherwise, there&#x2019;s no point in even starting.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-pncxxs etfikam0\">Oleg Matsnev contributed research.</p></div><aside class=\"css-ew4tgv\"></aside></div></section></div>",

If successful, the warehouse would be the first union at Amazon in the US, as many Amazon workers in Europe are<a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2021/03/25/amazon-alabama-europe-unions/\"> already unionized.</a></p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;This campaign has already been a victory in many ways. Even though we don&#x2019;t know how the vote will turn out, we believe we have opened the door to more organizing around the country, and we have exposed the lengths to which employers will go to crush their employees trying to gain a union voice,&#x201D; said Stuart Appelbaum, president of RWDSU. &#x201C;This campaign has become the prime example for why we need labor law reform in this country.&#x201D;</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Around 5,800 employees were eligible to vote in the election, with a majority of those who voted to determine the outcome.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The results could take a while to be finally counted and the process could be legally fraught. The NLRB said it will not have an estimate for how long the vote count will take until counting begins. The union estimated it will take about a week for results.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">During the vote count, the union and Amazon will have the opportunity to challenge the veracity of ballots and <a href=\"https://www.nlrb.gov/news-outreach/fact-sheets/nlrb-representation-case-procedures-fact-sheet/main-steps-representation\">file</a> objections within five business days of the vote count. </p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The results could also be delayed if enough ballots are challenged to affect the outcome of the election, at which point a hearing officer with the NLRB will determine whether a challenged ballot will be counted. </p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Amazon aggressively <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2021/feb/03/amazon-intensifies-severe-effort-discourage-first-warehouse-union\">opposed</a> the union organizing efforts at the Bessemer warehouse, encouraging workers to vote &#x201C;no&#x201D; in the election through posters, signs, mailings, a <a href=\"https://www.doitwithoutdues.com/\">website</a>, texts, <a href=\"https://www.businessinsider.com/amazon-anti-union-ads-removed-by-twitch-alabama-warehouse-2021-2\">ads</a>, captive audience meetings, and hired union avoidance consultants at nearly $10,000 per day ahead of the election. Under the <a href=\"https://www.epi.org/publication/pro-act-problem-solution-chart/\">Pro Act</a>, a labor law reform bill supported by Democrats and labor unions around the US, employers would be prohibited from forcing workers into captive audience meetings, and fines would significantly be increased for labor law violations.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">The union drive has received <a href=\"https://southernworker.org/amazon/\">support</a> from unions and organizations in the Bessemer area and around the US. Several congress members <a href=\"https://www.cnbc.com/2021/03/05/lawmakers-show-solidarity-for-amazon-union-vote-in-alabama.html\">visited</a> the union organizing site over the past few weeks to show their support for the workers.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;This election is important because it&#x2019;s the start to addressing inadequate working conditions,&#x201D; said Eric Hall, founder of the Black Lives Matter chapter in Birmingham, Alabama, which has supported the union organizing efforts and participated in rallies to garner community support for the workers.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">An <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/03/29/technology/amazon-union-vote.html\">estimated 85%</a> of the Amazon warehouse workers in Bessemer are Black.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">&#x201C;Birmingham is a city known for its strong stance for civil rights. Its people led a rebellion against racism and Jim Crow, and in this present day movement it&#x2019;s the grand and great grandchildren fighting against today&#x2019;s injustices, fighting against the rich and powerful, fighting systemic racism, fighting economic and social injustice,&#x201D; said Hall.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">According to the RWDSU, hundreds of Amazon workers around the US have<a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2021-03-19/amazon-workers-inspired-by-alabama-weigh-union-drives-elsewhere\"> reached out</a> to the union during the Alabama organizing effort with interests to start union organizing within their workplaces.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">As the union election in Alabama concluded, Amazon executives increasingly attacked their critics, with recent spars on social media from Amazon CEO Dave Clark and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/amazonnews/status/1375529101931520007\">Amazon&#x2019;s communications team</a> against<a href=\"https://twitter.com/davehclark/status/1375045409542823939\"> Senator Bernie Sanders</a>, Senator Elizabeth Warren and Congressman Mark Pocan.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">According to Recode, the tweets came after Amazon founder Jeff Bezos <a href=\"https://www.vox.com/recode/2021/3/28/22354604/amazon-twitter-bernie-sanders-jeff-bezos-union-alabama-elizabeth-warren\">expressed </a>dismay that executives weren&#x2019;t pushing back enough on criticism toward the company.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">Shortly after Amazon&#x2019;s PR account claimed reports workers urinate in bottles due to their inability to take bathroom breaks during shifts are false, The Intercept <a href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/03/25/amazon-drivers-pee-bottles-union/\">reported </a>on leaked emails and memos where Amazon management discussed problems with delivery drivers urinating in plastic bottles and defecating in plastic bags.</p><p class=\"css-6ebghe\">An <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a> spokesperson said in an email: &#x201C;We don&#x2019;t believe the RWDSU represents the majority of our employees&#x2019; views. Our employees choose to work at <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/technology/amazon\">Amazon</a> because we offer some of the best jobs available everywhere we hire, and we encourage anyone to compare our total compensation package, health benefits, and workplace environment to any other company with similar jobs.&#x201D;</p></div>",
